  "Dedication: This story is dedicated to women suffering from the damage of sexual childhood abuseA struggle to enlightenmentWhen a child is violated by other humans, healing may take several lifetimes",
  "ForewordSpirituality is our very individual and personal development",
  "Most people will have to learn that each has a uniquely personal idea of what enlightenment exactly is",
  "It never feels the same for all",
  " That is why it is so hard to explain",
  "As there are countless books, clubs, videos, and exercises available to aid in spiritual development, not everything is fitting for everyone\u2019s understanding",
  "It is definitely beneficial to have many different forms of information available because we all come with a different human understanding and ego",
  "It is advised to read what makes sense to you and what you feel drawn to",
  "Many engage in just what is fashionable among peers to join a \u201cmovement\u201d or guru \u2013 to be part of something",
  "This may create a detour and turmoil",
  "It is most important allowing each person to find what is suitable for their life at their own pace and understanding",
  "Forced information is not likely to be perceived sustainably and may even prolong a spiritual development rather than further it",
  "Sometimes reading too many books might be counterproductive, as we are submitting our brain to many (sometimes competitive) ideas, which can be confusing and leading to nothing positive",
  " Intellectual understanding will not automatically change the emotional pattern developed throughout lifetimes",
  "Applying intellectual understanding to everyday experiences is definitely not as easy as that",
  " It has to \u201cclick\u201d somehow in order to follow through effectively",
  "Consistent training is needed to identify and change any habits and patterns interfering with inner peace and happiness",
  "It takes immense willpower and strength to stay consistent with a goal in mind",
  "This can be done with the aid of continuous meditation, prayers, or mantra repetition",
  "Guidance should be searched for and chosen by self and not others",
  "Only you can truly motivate yourself",
  "Pure and sincere intention is the most powerful drive to archive what you want",
  "Adding passion and love to the mix makes success inevitable",
  "A person with major depression and anxiety will need consistency within a balanced and supportive environment avoiding triggers",
  "That is hard to find as life, in general, seems to be full of challenges, mostly driven by ego",
  "Many humans go through damaging experiences throughout their lives working hard to get rid of stigma and judgments",
  "Especially self-judgment",
  "Yes, this is the most important acknowledgment",
  "With the concept of \u201cwhat I think and do, I think others would do too\u201d, we are a supreme judge for self and others",
  "This often leads to a lack of self-love",
  " If you don\u2019t love yourself unconditionally, you are simply not able to fully love someone else",
  " Dedicating your life to others without regards to your own might sound heroic, but is not based on love",
  " What you don\u2019t have, you can\u2019t give",
  "There are unique motivations for looking out for others more than yourself",
  "Being loved by others is for many the ultimate goal",
  "Most likely, relationships are doomed to fall apart if you are looking for love provided by someone outside yourself",
  "You have to be the base for love by loving yourself first",
  "In my mind, the only sin in life is not loving or living it to its fullest capacity you can envision",
  "If you can\u2019t envision it, you won\u2019t be able to fulfill it",
  "Living life to the fullest is living a purpose",
  "Do you know your purpose",
  "I have lost mine often and felt lost to the world as we see it",
  " Nobody knows this about me",
  "I am one of those people who give to others what I long for myself",
  "This has turned out to be an ineffective method of communicating what I want for myself",
  "I created an expectation and was promptly disappointed",
  " This is not fair to self or others",
  "One of my dreams was to create a healing environment where every morning starts with laughter and joy to fill the spirit with the strength needed to face the rest of the day",
  " A place where you learn with absolute certainty to love yourself unconditionally",
  "People would stay for 21 days to condition this process",
  " It is said that we humans can create a habit if we do the same every day for 21 days",
  "I guess I am not much a creature of habits, and it takes me most of my life to form one single practice that I don\u2019t already have",
  "Be aware of resistance called ego",
  "Ego is part of us, and if we allow it, it will control our lives",
  "If controlled, the ego can be wonderful",
  " The ego represents a person\u2019s self-esteem and self-importance",
  "Depending on how well you have your ego in check, it can make your life heaven or hell",
  " Ego is something you can train to serve you or destroy you and many others on the way",
  "The energy of a strong ego aligned with others as a collective consciousness is so powerful, that it can create war or peace when out of balance",
  "Some humans who search for their own awakening may feel insecure and muddled by the many options presented via media, through well-meaning friends and judgmental congregations",
  "Others need many lifetimes to find a direct approach to enlightenment",
  " Few are there instantly",
  "Actually, looking back, we all are there instantly",
  " It just takes some time for the majority of humans to feel instant awareness",
  "Awakening to the knowledge we already have but ultimately forgotten is a very intimate process and ideally should be encouraged and supported by people close to you without interference or judgment unless requested",
  "Never should this process be judged or influenced by one\u2019s own agenda",
  " Nor should you go out and preach your point of view as the only pass to heaven",
  "No one is ever more or less evolved",
  " Wherever we are in our lives, it is exactly where we choose to be",
  "There is no rule or law on how and in what order we achieve enlightenment",
  "For many, there is so much to relearn in order to fully embrace who we are",
  "Nowadays, countless \u2018gurus\u2019 offering services and advice for a price some are unable to pay",
  "Many of these teachers do not have the tolerance to accept another point of view outside their own understanding",
  "So, we must rely on our own instincts to determine what we learn, understand, believe, and practice",
  "Know, that even a guru is no more than the rest of humanity \u2013 no more than you",
  "The challenge I am having with many \u201cspiritual teachers\u201d is that they insist that there is only one way to reach enlightenment \u2013 theirs",
  "Though I am in awe of many Gurus, I often experienced the feeling to be thought of lesser",
  " These are my own thoughts \u2013 my responsibility",
  "When bowing down to a guru, I do this out of respect for their dedication and awe of their knowledge (and because it\u2019s a way to greet someone from a distance)",
  " We need to figure out how this fits into our personal understanding of self",
  " My idea of heaven is indestructible inner peace",
  "I don\u2019t think I have experienced that yet for longer than brief moments \u2013 at least that\u2019s what I thought until now",
  "It occurred to me that we can call every moment in our lives a lifetime",
  "I did experience moments of happiness and sometimes even bliss",
  "If I had focused on these moments during trying times, hell wouldn\u2019t, no, couldn\u2019t dominate",
  " I am learning to understand this better and better as I am writing",
  "How could we tell the difference between good and bad, unless we experience it",
  "It seems to me that going downhill is much easier than up-hill",
  "So, it is simpler to be sad than happy",
  "It doesn\u2019t take much effort",
  "This is so apparent, yet it seems so weird to me",
  "Energy appears to have gravity",
  " We don\u2019t consciously choose sadness",
  " We are merely having a hard time climbing up to euphoria when we down",
  "Our energy is depleted and this is when we are experiencing hell",
  " When you are dead, you will not create hell unless you yourself had generated it during a lifetime and couldn\u2019t overcome it",
  "This is one of my biggest fears",
  "I don\u2019t want to end this human experience on a depressing note",
  "I believe that if I do, I will have to deal with the same stuff again and again until I am able to let go and choose something I enjoy more",
  "Why don\u2019t I just choose something more enjoyable",
  "Because we have often forgotten how",
  "We all share the same basic knowledge",
  " However, we should seek individual sources to manifest once again what we had forgotten",
  " We don\u2019t share the same awareness",
  " Jesus was a public speaker or guru who did not desire to be worshiped",
  "He merely wanted to share his knowledge with people, so they may realize their own uniqueness and wholeness with \u201call\u201d there is",

  " We are designed to think, create, and make decisions",
  " I believe we all are god divided by ego",
  " Not a body with a spirit, but a spirit with a body",
  "It is NOT a God outside us who decides \u2013 it is mainly our ego we allow making the choices for our life",
  " Maybe you will understand it with this example",
  "If you have a beautiful natural garden but chose to take out the flowers and pour concrete on that spot",
  " Is that a decision a God would have made",
  "Of course not",
  " It was your idea that you would have less maintenance if you just get rid of the flowers, and you chose to obey what your mind suggested without hesitation or consideration for God",
  "And don\u2019t even think of blaming your mind",

  "Letting go of ailments, derived from emotional turmoil and unresolved past issues, and surrendering to Love, is the only way to conduct a happy and drama-free life",
  "This all sounds easy, and is easy but also very difficult at the same time",
  "It comes down to awareness, willpower, and intentions",
  "Unhappiness is somewhat an addiction and happiness is hard to find within for most",
  "First, you have to identify that you are responsible for anything you bring to your world \u2013 without shame or blame",
  " It is a battle between Ego and God and you are the only one who can determine who has the upper hand",
  "Let me be very clear about this",
  "Overcoming a life (or many) of victimhood will always be a work in progress, just like overcoming alcoholism",
  "One day at a time",
  "This is all part of human experiences",
  "We are never free of the danger to fall back into old patterns because old patterns are never completely erased from the emotional body",
  "We always have to reinforce strength and confidence to achieve a happy life",
  " A healthy, supportive, and balanced environment is key",
  "Working on a sense of self-worth is challenged by daily experiences with negativity around and within us",
  "Finding a way of caring without attachment to the outcome, or expectations from the receiver of your love is a constant struggle which often leads to disappointments and letting go of supportive practices",
  "The following is the story of a woman working on overcoming victimhood and ending an unhappy cycle of many lives",
  "It is my story and it takes much strength and courage to go back in time to share it",
  "I am 70 years old and though I\u2019d married 5 times, I never had a wedding dress, never received a ring from the man I married, never had a true connection, never had a healthy relationship with a man, never had happy and satisfying sex, and lastly, I never had gotten to know who I am because from early childhood on I had to pretend in order to accommodate the people in my environment and myself",
  " I never felt that I belonged",
  "In order to avoid facing and feeling my troubles on a daily, I became a powerful rescuer for others with a focus on their troubles and struggles",
  "It is what kept me alive then",
  "I helped until I was no longer needed \u2013 not understanding how ineffective my aid was",
  "I didn\u2019t realize then that it is impossible to live the lives of other people",
  "To this day I realized that every thought, every deed, every emotion had a major influence on how I conducted my life",
  "I understood that I am the ONLY person who is capable of healing my body and mind",
  "No doctor, medicine, scripture, or operation is able to do more than aiding into healing with me making the choices for what is needed",
  "The search for enlightenment, inner peace, and unconditional love is a never-ending journey",
  "I pray for the strength needed to complete my path naturally",
  " There are still days in my life when I feel completely broken and unable to connect with other humans on a genuine deeper and loving level \u2013 Depression",
  "Throughout my entire life, I struggled with depression, anxiety, PTSD, low self-esteem, lack of self-worth, and infinite loneliness in my heart",
  "I felt easily discarded by many",
  "Today I understand that I had voluntarily, but subconsciously created this reality-based upon my childhood experiences",
  " However, very few people ever knew this about me",
  "Most would describe me as energetic, alpha, loving, caring, upbeat, and full of life",
  "I tried to take my own life six times and almost succeeded at the last attempt when I took 100 antidepressants my friend had in his possession",
  "It was about 20 years ago when I had an NDE (near-death experience)",
  "I remember still so much about it",
  "It had changed my life because I got to asked questions and received answers from a power I had not been aware of \u2013 not that closely anyway",
  "Throughout the next 20 years, I had lost and found the awareness of my knowledge over and over again",
  " What helped me surviving, was my relentless search for a connection to another human, my infinite need to feel worthy and matter to someone, and the deep need to belong",

  "I hurt myself a lot",
  "I never allowed myself to create roots and often question my sense of purpose when in a depressive phase",
  "I believed my parents, uncle, and ants when they told me that I was worthless and because of it deserved nothing good",
  "I believed them because I was a child and they were my guides",
  "I thought that all girls have to go through what I experienced",
  "No one told or showed me differently",
  "So, I agreed with what I was told",
  "Intellectually, I understand now that I had to break these damaging agreements in order to heal",
  "It was not as easy as that",
  "It felt to me that my experiences were carved into my DNA",
  "I tried so many things to overcome who I became",
  "I desperately wanted to heal",
  "Depression surfaced more and more often and during these phases, I fell back into the black hole I kept trying to climb out of",
  "My behavioral pattern developed from these experiences, and I did not believe that it could be changed easily",
  "The hardest task was to unlearn behavioral patterns while in a difficult environment",
  "During one phase of deep depression, I did accept the medication offered by my doctor because I no longer cared \u2013 it almost killed me",
  "I vegetated in bed for nine months mostly thinking about how I could die without hurting others with my actions",
  "Anger towards my medical professionals and their ignorance prompted me to fight for myself again",
  "With a new surge for life, I searched for answers on the internet to end this gruesome agonizing emotional pain",
  "I almost consented to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), when Ayahuasca came up during my research",
  "ECT is dangerous because it erases memories and it will not be by choice which memories you erase during this procedure",
  "Ayahuasca (Banisteriopsis caapi) is a vine of the jungle, which grows in the entire Amazonia, from Columbia to Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, and Guyana",
  "It is known to and respected by all indigenous peoples as a healing plant or master \u201cteacher plant\u201d and represents the basis of their traditional medicines",
  "Medicine is used to treat many ailments in its core and eliminate the cause",
  "Total healing can occur",
  "So, I elected to travel to Peru to work with Ayahuasca and started preparation",
  "First I weaned myself off all meds within 3 weeks",
  " Then, I started a strict diet suggested for the Ayahuasca treatments",
  "The preparations alone were so invigorating, that I found myself having hope again",
  "Traveling to the Peruvian jungle was exciting and took my mind off everything else",
  " The contrast of wild beauty in the jungle and the poverty among the people who in spite of it demonstrated happiness and joy for life was astonishing",
  "After my arrival, I met with the Shaman for an initial consultation",
  " He was already aware of my story and let me know that in my case, it may take a few months healing instead of two weeks",
  " The process with Ayahuasca was not an easy one, because it was accompanied by horrible nausea and purging",
  "I did six ceremonies and started to feel better and better, every day in every way",
  "After my last ceremony, I was dancing and singing",
  "I had not danced or sang for so many years",
  "The plant medicine did help a lot and I came home feeling almost healed",
  " I was able to let go of many damaging memories and emotions",
  " Unfortunately, upon my return, I still lived within a difficult environment I could no control, and as a result, depression came back like a raging lover manifested in physical ailments like Fibromyalgia within a few months",
  " I essentially wound up in a wheelchair, unable to walk more than a few steps",
  "I went to Peru again to consult with a Shaman, a Healer, and Ayahuasca",
  "After six more ceremonies with Ayahuasca, I felt stronger every day returned fully restored physically",
  "There is so much to be said about the understanding I gained through plant medicine",
  "Though depression still keeps returning without warning, I learned to monitor my mind and behavior closely to detect early signs of the darkness (depression) returning, so I could effectively nip it in the butt at the beginning stages",
  "I never wanted to take medications again as they just created another ailment and robbed my mind of its clarity",
  "I used Marihuana to control anxiety and at night allow my body and mind to rest",
  " I educated myself about my brain and body functions, and what I could do to make it all better",
  "I still have much work to do, every day in every way",
  "Fighting for my life became my life throughout my life, and I was pretty resourceful and always found a little straw of hope to hold on to",
  "I never knew a different life than fighting and struggling",
  "I kept researching in order to understand what I could do to cure depression and enhance my life without the use of mind-altering medications",
  "While writing about my journey, I learned and grew so much, but I have little advice for others, as everybody is so very unique and not one medicine or advice is right for all",
  "Maybe others see an opportunity for themselves through my story",
  "Maybe some words trigger an awakening moment for the reader of my story and they find the courage to take on a changing journey with awareness and self-love",
  "I\u2019ll let you know that throughout my struggles, I had also many adventures and experiences, more than any people I met in my life",
  "My life was interesting",
  "It often felt like I lived many lives in one lifetime",
  " I still feel gratitude for that",
  "I was able to see myself from the outside in and evaluate my state of mind",
  "This way I could remove myself from emotional triggers as soon as I identified them",
  " This worked most of the time",

  "That very knowledge provided healing from depression and anxiety within a brief moment",
  "Yes, I am free and I know how to be happy with myself and no longer needy of the praise from others",
  "If my words can help to change someone else\u2019s view of life or trigger an \u2018AHA-moment\u2019, I believe my journey had a purpose, and I have gratitude for my experiences",

  "My story may not sound like a nice story and you may wonder what good it does to write this down",

  "I also hope to find more inner peace for myself through writing, as I have often lost my sense of purpose in this lifetime",
  " My journey is not finished by far, and even now, so many years later, I am still busy cleaning my mental house",
  "I still try to surrender to God and have not found my way, though sometimes it feels like I am close",

  "This story will describe the first 30 years of personal struggle resulting from severe childhood traumas",
  "It will also describe in detail how I have fought for my life and finally hope to be ably to conquer Major Depression, PTSD, and anxiety which had manifested an array of physical illnesses after many years of suffering",
  "My early childhood abusers are mostly men (and a few women) from my family",
  "Now, that everyone involved (except myself) is dead, I can and must speak up",
  "Though I have forgiven my abusers, it seems to me that my emotional body can\u2019t forget and models my behaviors as a result",
  "I hope my story inspires others to take charge of their lives and start living it to the fullest no matter what their history was",
  " I also hope it prevents some child abuse and encourages parents to support their children unconditionally",

  "Like with every living creature, the environment we are raised in is influencing our entire journey on earth",
  "Even when we start forming our own opinions about life, it is still based on the conditioning behaviors and outlook on life learned as a child",

  "I was a cute and bright little girl, full of fantasies about what life could be for me, even though I was sexually abused since age 2",
  " I didn\u2019t think of it as abuse then, because I didn\u2019t know that what was done to me was so wrong",
  "My parents were simple middle-class people with the dream of building a home and creating a \u201cbetter\u201d life",
  "Up to date, I don\u2019t know what their expectations of a \u201cbetter\u201d life was, or if they ever achieved it",
  "They never talked about it",
  " My mother was a member of Hitler Youth during WW2, and my father was a marine until he was wounded and hid in the mountains of the Schw\u00e4bische Alb, Germany",
  "I learned this information from a woman who cared for my father when he was wounded in WW2",
  "My parents never shared with their children how they had met",
  " The women\u2019s name was Klara",
  " She told me that my mother followed my father into hiding to be with him",
  " They had not married yet",
  " I learned later that my father was already married at that time, but that his wife defected to the Russians",
  " They initiated the annulment of this marriage",
  "Times were hard and neither one of them had any money",
  "Klara\u2019s house was a humble refuge with a Sofa in the living room serving as their bed",
  "During this particular time, my mother got pregnant with her first child, my brother",
  "It was apparent to Klara, that my mother had great dreams about becoming a lady of society and so she insisted to get married at once, and it was no surprise to her that my brother was born \u201cpremature\u201d",
  "Klara also told me that my mother was fiercely protective of my father and wouldn\u2019t want to share him with anyone, even though he was a social creature, so fun-loving with everybody around him",
  "People liked to be in my father\u2019s company",
  " He made them laugh and forget their problems for a while",
  "Sixteen months after my brother\u2019s arrival, I was born and my parents moved back to Eastern Germany to be close to family",
  "My father had nine siblings, and Mother had ten",
  "Unfortunately, only seven of her siblings and six of my father\u2019s siblings survived WW2",
  "We called my mother \u201cMutti\u201d, and my Father \u201cPapa\u201d",
  "Papa was handsome, mostly light-hearted, and a very good craftsman who loved a simple and happy life during these first years of their lives together",
  "He had charisma and people enjoyed his company",
  "I remember him playing his banjo and singing along with the instrument",
  " Even Mutti chimed in once in a while",
  " She had a lovely singing voice",
  " I wish she would have kept on singing throughout her lifetime",
  "Everything would have turned out very different for sure",
  "I loved my father especially during the first years of my life",
  " I trusted him even though he was a strict disciplinarian",
  " He was not like the other men in our family then and I felt safe with him",
  "When I was about 12 years old, I realized that Papa had given up on his dreams because he got tired of fighting for himself",
  "Tired of her nagging, he reluctantly resigned to Mutti\u2019s ideas on how life should be conducted",
  "The banjo was put away in the attic, and there was no more singing",
  "My mother was very ambitious and pushed him to work more and harder for a richer lifestyle",
  "He became quiet, stopped playing his banjo, and didn\u2019t sing anymore",
  "He only worked and his disappointment with his life became apparent in his behavior",
  "He resigned because in Mutti\u2019s eyes, no matter what he did, it just wasn\u2019t good enough for her",
  "It made him sad and he lost his happiness more and more",
  "Around the same time, we purchased our first TV and between work and the shows, there was no more time for family togetherness",
  "I despised my father\u2019s weakness and lost respect",
  " He was supposed to be the strength to draw from, in my mind",
  "I was angry that the only stability I thought to have was weakening and no longer dependable",
  "We, the children had to assume roles we were not ready for",
  " I had to run the household literally by the book at age 12, meaning that I had to keep a household book recording everything I did and any money that was spent for all of us",
  " I did the cooking, the cleaning, and shopping",
  "My mother was very controlling and jealousy often fogged her mood and actions",
  "She didn\u2019t want to share my father with anyone, including with me, his only daughter",
  " But that is another story\u2026",
  "",
  "not mine",
  "Moving to the WestWhen I was just 5 years of age, my parents decided that they wanted better opportunities, and so, they fled with us to the western side of Germany leaving everything behind \u2013 including all of our relatives",
  "We had no one in this part of the country",
  "For the first seven months, we lived in a refugee camp sharing one about 400 square foot room with another family",
  "The room was only divided by thick green military blankets",
  " Everything, absolutely everything could be heard on both sides of the blanket wall",
  "There was little to no privacy",
  "Each family had two bunk beds and a table in the center with 2 chairs",
  " My parents sat on the chairs, while we kids sat on the lower bunk when we ate",
  "Metal closets with individual locks were lined in the hallway for the family\u2019s personal belongings",
  "There was one kitchen in each barrack for meal preparations to be shared by 10 families",
  "Often we had only a slice of bread dunked in cold coffee or water with sugar on top for breakfast",
  "Every morning we were dropped off at a daycare center within the refugee camp",
  "I hated the daycare where we were treated like prisoners",
  "Every day about noontime, we had to lay down for 2 hours and close our eyes, while the caregivers had their break",
  "They took turns to make sure no one opened their eyes until it was allowed",
  "I was one of the toughest kids in my age group and even above",
  "I climbed the highest trees, fought like a boy, and came up with creative ideas to enhance our childhood at the refugee camp",
  "I thought I was a privileged kid because men and boys liked me",
  "I thought they loved my spunk and fearless adventurism",
  "I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong",
  "One day I got sick and had to stay in bed while my brother went to Preschool and my parents to work",
  "We had no babysitters, or someone checking in with me",
  "My mother put a slice of bread and some water on the table for me to eat",
  " I even remember getting an apple \u2013 which was a rare treat",
  "On the other side of the blanket lived a couple with a 16-year-old boy",
  "This boy was home that day and promised to look in on me often",
  "So, after our parents left, he crossed to our side of the room and told me that we should play some games to pass the time, and I readily agreed",
  "He started with a guessing game of body parts",
  "I remember getting increasingly uncomfortable when he insisted that we touch the body parts we named on the other person",
  "I didn\u2019t want to play anymore and told him that I needed to sleep because I was sick",
  "He told me that he would leave me alone if I would just lift my nightgown for a brief moment",
  "I was scared because my mother didn\u2019t allow us to wear anything underneath the nightgown",
  "When I hesitated, the boy lifted my gown and pushed me down while frantically masturbating his penis on my stomach until a white creamy liquid came out of him",
  "He started making distressed sounds and his face looked like he was in pain",
  "I was horrified and cried a lot",
  " I had not seen this with my uncle and this was different than he had taught me",
  "After he dressed again, he wiped my belly with toilet paper and told me to keep quiet",
  " He threatened to kill our entire family in our sleep if I said anything to anyone",
  "I was truly terrified and felt responsible for my family\u2019s life at age 5",
  "No one came to rescue me",
  " I had no one to tell",
  "I was accustomed to being the interest of several of the male members of my family",
  "  It was my normal whenever I visited with my relatives during school vacation",
  "The boy in the refugee camp was not the first liking my body this way",
  " There were several grown men of my extended family involved in conditioning me for my future as a woman",
  "One of my uncles had chosen to instill my first understanding of self-value by raping me at age two",
  " I really don\u2019t remember this particular event",
  " It came out during a hypnosis session I tried as an adult in order to understand what had me so broken and incapable of creating healthy relationships",
  "My first conscious memories of sexual activities in my life started at age 5, prior to our escape from the communistic part of Germany when I stayed with my uncle\u2019s family for a week while my parents prepared for the move to West Germany",
  "My uncle had two children on his own and my grandparents thought it would be much more entertaining for me than staying with them",
  " He was the youngest of my mother\u2019s brothers and everybody liked him",
  "I remember the first evening in his house vividly",
  "I wished most of my life that I could forget the smell and the pain and fear",
  "After a day of child play with my cousins, my bed was made in the living room on the couch",
  "I slept soundly when I woke by feeling rough hands under my nightgown",
  "A voice hissing into my ear telling me to be quiet",
  "He told me that I have the privilege to learn early on what it means to be a good woman for a man",
  "The alcohol on my uncle\u2019s breath was a scent that followed me throughout my life",
  "His large smelly hand covered my entire face and I could hardly breathe",
  "I was so frightened when I felt his other hand pulling up my nightgown and something hard and wet forced its way between my legs",
  "The pain, when he penetrated me, was re-lived throughout my entire life with every intercourse",
  "This was different",
  "Most men just wanted me to touch them and play doctor with them",
  "My uncle told me that he would teach me what women are therefor in this world",
  "When he was done, he threatened to do harm to my family if I told anyone",
  "He said that this was our special secret and that I was special to him",
  "He also said that no one would believe me anyway",
  " This went on every evening for the entire week and I was so scared of these nightly encounters",
  "It just didn\u2019t feel right or good",
  "I pleaded with my aunt to let me sleep with her kids, but she was afraid we would keep each other up all night",
  "She didn\u2019t understand why I was scared to sleep in the living room on the couch",
  "Though I didn\u2019t know at that point that what my uncle did was wrong, it felt not right to me",
  "All my instincts wanted to tell on him, yet I didn\u2019t tell anyone for many years, because in the end I thought of it to be normal for girls and I really didn\u2019t have anyone to confide in",
  "I also never forgot his threat that he would harm my family",
  " Every time I felt guilt and shame to no extent and didn\u2019t understand why",
  "Early on in my life, I became in my eyes the protector of my family by keeping this secret",
  "Shortly after that incident we fled from Eastern Germany and landed in a refugee camp for about seven months before moving to a better place",
  " My parents were very hard-working people with the ambition to make a better life for us all",
  "So, it was a real step up when they found a rental apartment within a nicer community",
  "However, their ultimate goal was to have their own home",
  "Because they worked very hard to build their home, my brother and I were left to our own devices most of the time and they explained their absence with the remark that whatever they did was meant to benefit us",
  " Many children had a key around their neck during these times",
  "Nobody had the money for babysitters or even thought of hiring one",
  "We were raised to be self-reliant",
  "Seeing children at a young age with a key around their neck was normal",
  "My parents kept reassuring us that everything they did was for our benefit",
  "It didn\u2019t turn out that way",
  " No benefit for us ever surfaced \u2013 in my opinion",
  " On the contrary, I was made a housekeeper starting age 7, while my brother had to tend to the basement and keeping the shoes of the family shiny",
  " After all, he was a male, and housework was for females \u2013 in my parent\u2019s eyes",
  "I was expected to keep a household book, plan, and prepare meals at age 10, while my parents went to work for a better life",
  " My mother was very frugal with the money",
  " Our meals were always simple, cheap, and plenty",
  "Unfortunately, Mutti also was thrifty with words of encouragement and praise for the work I did around the house",
  "Usually, she only commented on what was not done or didn\u2019t match her expectations",
  "I anticipated severe physical punishment and removal of any privileges when she wasn\u2019t satisfied with my work",
  "The privileges would be, not being yelled at and no punishments",
  "This became the norm in my life",
  "Our food was simple and very basic for most parts",
  "I never knew what a steak was until I was an adult",
  "But then again, we had always enough to eat and could never complain about being hungry &#8211; unless we were being punished and had to go to bed without food",
  "This happened at least once weekly",
  "I loved the holidays and visitors because our food then was delicious and elaborate, and my parents were nice to us in the wake of the company",
  "Papa loved to cook sometimes and he was always very creative with the preparation of his meals",
  "His food was so good that my brother and I fought for a chance to lick the pots and pans",
  "My father was always served first and received the largest piece of everything \u2013 after all, he was the major breadwinner, and his strength needed to be kept up",
  "Kids were not allowed to speak at the table",
  "So, we didn\u2019t share the events of the day and had to listen quietly to my parent\u2019s conversations",
  "My mother was by far stricter than my father",
  "She did not tolerate anything she could not control",
  "Often when Papa came home from work, Mutti greeted him by complaining about us (mostly me) and insisted that we deserve to be beaten",
  "Both of my parents were very fast with physical punishments which were passed out generously; mostly in form of beating with whatever was close and available",
  "This included a garden hose, rug beater, umbrella, and coat hangers",
  "There were times I could not attend school due to open wounds on my back and legs",
  "Sometimes when we went for our Sunday afternoon walks, my father would go out of his way to find a willow branch which he found to be most effective for beating good manners into his children",
  " Usually, Papa stopped beating me when he saw blood",
  "He then tended to the wounds and I felt that he was sorry for what he did",
  "So, when I could foresee a physical punishment, I ran up the stairs very fast, hit my nose with my fist, and ran back down",
  " I would get a nose bleed after the first or second hit and my father stopped beating on me then",
  "Yes, I was very resourceful and clever all my life",
  "My mother on the other hand was never sorry when punishing us",
  " She would bite, scratch, and pull hair if nothing else was in reach until she was exhausted",
  "Other punishments when not in school included being locked up in our rooms without food all day until they came back from work",
  "A bucket was placed into our rooms for reliving ourselves, but often we had no water all day",
  "My room was upstairs, my brothers was in the basement",
  " After my parents had left for work when I was locked up, I called out to a school friend across from our home through the open window",
  "His name was Kalle, and he would make sure I got something to eat and drink by placing items into a basket tied onto my bedsheet I let down from my window",
  " Kalle was the first male that took care of me without demanding physical rewards",
  " He was my first boyfriend and he was the one I practiced kissing with",
  "Writing about being locked up reminded me of an incident when I was only 3 years old",
  " This I actually remember",
  "We lived in a rural area and had an outhouse in our yard",
  " The door of this small building was huge and heavy",
  "Much too heavy to move by myself",
  "Yet, I was expected to use the outhouse during the day",
  "My mother locked me overnight in our small chicken coop because I had left the door to the outhouse open, and her favorite chicken had drowned in the toilet",
  "She was furious over the loss and her anger energy could be perceived physically",
  "I was afraid of my mother\u2019s rage",
  "The night in the chicken coop was one of the most scary experiences in my young life and left a lasting scar in my mind",
  "The room was dark, and the chickens kept clucking, quite annoyed having to share the small space with a human who didn\u2019t belong there",
  " The smell was nauseating",
  "It was so dark, I could not see the hand in front of my face because everything was closed up from the outside",
  "Nobody would hear my screams, no one came when I sobbed aloud in horror",
  "When I realized that nobody would come and get me, I huddled quietly crying against the wall in a corner to protect myself from the pecking beaks of the chickens",
  "I didn\u2019t sleep a minute and my mind was scared of fear and horror",
  "Today, I still feel claustrophobic when in a confined area",
  " I still experience nightmares",
  "Later in life, when punishment was needed during school days, we went to bed hungry",
  "On occasions, when my parents were at peace, we benefitted from their good mood and sometimes would get some chocolate or we would play a board game, and it felt almost like harmony in the house",
  " I craved these moments",
  " I craved them all my life until I understood much later in life that I could create them for myself and didn\u2019t have to look for someone providing them for me",
  "Mostly, these minutes were very short and depended on Mutti\u2019s mood",
  "They would end without prior warning or reasons I could understand",
  "I never felt relaxed and secure at any moment",
  "My mother would blame me for all the disharmony which made me feel barely tolerated",
  "I did everything a child could think of to recreate harmonious events",
  "Most of my good deeds were met with suspicion of covering up something bad I may have done",
  "Perhaps I did that too",
  "My best memories were when we went into the forest on holidays for picnics with friends of my parents",
  "Whenever people were around, my mother displayed much care and affection for her children",
  "Though I despised that because it didn\u2019t felt honest, I took advantage of any peaceful moment",
  "It was apparent that Mutti did not like me much",
  "I was a huge disappointment to her",
  "She wanted a girly girl who would spend her time knitting or sewing, wearing pretty dresses, and be like her",
  "Someone she could mold and control easily",
  "She was a great seamstress and would have loved to dress me with whatever seemed girly to her",
  "She wanted to groom me to become a lady",
  "I was a tomboy",
  "I loved to play soccer and climb trees",
  "As a boy, I felt safer",
  "My brother told me that he was never molested and so I pretended to be a boy whenever possible",
  "One time, when my mother found me high up in a tree again, she wanted to embarrass me at school and made me wear my brother\u2019s Lederhosen as punishment",
  "I was 7 years old",
  "She thought that would cure me of acting like a boy",
  "I did not feel embarrassed",
  "On the contrary, I felt quite empowered by my new dress code",
  "I felt fearless and safe",
  "She told me that I was an ungrateful child and no one could ever genuinely like me",
  "I believed her to a point",
  "But men obviously liked at least my body",
  "At age 7, I suffered a 3rd-degree burn by my own brother",
  "There was a construction site on our road, and the workers had left a pot of tar boiling",
  "Out of curiosity, I stepped close to the huge black boiling pot when my brother took a large chunk of solid cold tar and threw it into the pot, splashing tar all over me",
  "My parents were at work and neighbors called an ambulance",
  "My clothing and even shoes were fused to my skin, and it is a true miracle that I got away without lasting scars",
  "I never told my parents that my brother was the culprit \u2013 they would have beaten him senseless",
  "As much as I didn\u2019t like my brother, I also didn\u2019t want to see him beaten",
  "Usually, I was the initiator of our childhood crimes",
  " I was very creative",
  "One evening, when my parents went out, my brother and I went on an adventure hoping to find a bicycle tire pump we could bring home because we lost the one we had and were scared of my parent\u2019s reaction when they would find out",
  "In the end, we were too afraid to steal one of someone else\u2019s bike and when we got back near our home, we saw in horror that my father\u2019s motorcycle entered our street",
  "We hid behind parked cars and after my parents had passed by on the way to the remote garage, we ran as fast as we could home and jumped into bed fully closed hoping not to be discovered",
  "Unfortunately, the neighbors had seen us and our illegal outing was exposed",
  " My creativity to get what I needed was unmatched in our house",
  "One day, Mutti brought home a huge box with winter apples from a place where she cleaned house for an older man",
  "She deposited the apples on top of the amour in their bedroom for further ripening until Christmas time when she would use them for baking and cooking",
  "One day I thought of a trade to get our hands on some chewing gum which was forbidden in our home",
  " I was very attracted to anything forbidden and I arranged a trade among the children in the neighborhood who had plenty of sweets every day",
  "So, I had my brother throwing down apples from the bedroom window and I collected the gum we traded from neighborhood children",
  "We enjoyed the gum and never thought of the repercussion of our clever enterprise that day",
  "Several weeks went by and I had all but forgotten about the apples when we heard my mother scream in anger",
  "It was a weekend in December, close to Christmas and Mutti planned to do some baking using apples she was sure to find in the bedroom",
  "She found only one single worm-infested fruit left on the amour and was furious",
  "For some reason, she never looked at my brother as the culprit",
  "So, I got a beating without an opportunity to defend myself",
  "I was also quite creative with stories defending what I did",
  "Unfortunately, my parent\u2019s motto was; beating first, talking (maybe) later",
  "If it turned out to be an unjust beating, we were told that we had one good for the next time",
  "Unfortunately, they never remembered anything about it when the next time came",
  "Though my brother was a year older, I was the one who got blamed automatically",
  "My brother had no unique ideas or any creative thinking at all",
  "So, it was me who had to suffer the consequences for most incidences",
  "I have gotten quite used to it and found ways to gain a nose bleed quickly, so my father stopped the beating after only a few hits because of the blood spritzing out of my nose",
  "I carefully evaluated if my plans were worth the expected beating prior to putting them into motion",
  " Though it hurts, physical punishment wasn\u2019t as scary to me as emotional abandonment or the withdrawal of all affection and communication",
  " Physical pain was not as sustainable as emotional suffering",
  "As I am writing this, I do realize that perhaps I was a real handful for my parents after all",
  "Every year my brother and I spent our summer vacation visiting my grandparents in Eastern Germany",
  "I remember these times so well",
  "My parents were not allowed to visit the Eastern part of Germany at that time, but we children had no problem getting permission",
  "I loved being away from my parents",
  "My grandparents loved me and showed it to me",
  "They appreciated my resilience and creativity",
  "My brother and I took long train rides to visit",
  "It was a great adventure for me, and when we arrived, my grandmother always said that the first dream we had would come true",
  "That was the main thing \u2013 a dream actually coming true",
  "Without a doubt, every visit my dream consisted of a pound of green sweet woodruff candy which was not available in western Germany",
  "They were my absolute favorites",
  "Promptly, in the morning, I found a pound of my dream candy on the nightstand next to me",
  "It was like magic to me for many years",
  "When my grandmother asked my brother about his dream, he always answered that he didn\u2019t have any dreams",
  "So, he didn\u2019t get anything",
  "My brother caught on to my \u201cassets\u201d and so when I was 8 years old my brother offered to lift my skirt to an older boy in exchange for some bubble gum",
  " My value as a woman was determined early on",
  "During one of our visits to my grandparents\u2019 house, I learned that I could not trust my Grandfather",
  "I was about 10 years old then, and whenever my brother and I visited our grandparents, I slept in their bed in front of my grandmother",
  "Their house was small and had only one extra bedroom",
  "One morning, my grandmother had to get up early to start the fire in the kitchen; it was cold and she asked me to stay undercover until the kitchen has warmed up",
  "I went promptly back to sleep and woke up feeling something big, soft, and slimy between my legs",
  "I was startled because it felt very different than with my uncle",
  "My grandfather was fingering me trying to push his limp member inside me",
  "Horrified and in shock, I got up quickly and joined my grandmother and my brother in the kitchen",
  "I was so confused about my grandfather\u2019s actions and didn\u2019t know what to do",
  " I did realize that this was not ok",
  "Later that day I confided in my brother what my grandfather had done",
  " He just laughed and thought it was a joke",
  " He was only a year older than I",
  "He didn\u2019t believe me",
  "My uncle was right",
  " No one would ever believe me",
  "At that stage in my life, it seemed to me that my path was set, and I didn\u2019t know that this was not normal behavior \u2013 even though it didn\u2019t feel right",
  " It seemed to me that men loved me this way",
  "I hated being a girl",
  "My uncle actually taught me what I needed to be doing to be \u2018loved\u2019 by men",
  " All this time I was convinced that it was my fault because my body had liked some of the molestations",
  "That made me feel dirty, guilty, and without value",
  "I felt that I was the most unworthy person in the universe and brought everything onto myself",
  " I hated my body because I felt betrayed by it",
  "I had nobody to talk to about this",
  "I did not enjoy being a girl, so I became a tomboy through and through; much to my mother\u2019s dismay",
  " At least men would leave me alone \u2013 so I hoped",
  "At age 8 I became too old for a knee ride by my uncle or grandfather",
  "My uncle kept stalking me when I was around and I tried to stay in the company of my cousins refusing to hear his call",
  "He talked my grandparents into taking me to his home, but I hid and rather accepted punishments that my uncle&#8217;s treatment",
  "When my uncle, who was my mother\u2019s baby brother, died in an accident, I felt so relieved",
  "Though everybody cried, I secretly rejoiced because one of my most brutal teachers was gone for good",
  " But the painful memory stayed forever \u2013 it became a permanent scar in my DNA",
  "My grandfather never attempted to touch me inappropriately again",
  "I forgave him and still loved him, but never trusted him again",
  "There were many different male family members, until age 14, teaching me what I was made for \u2013 the art of pleasing a man",
  "I believed them",
  " How could I not",
  "  They were all respected members of the family and community",
  "For most of my life, I believed to be unworthy of love and affection unless I give my body, and still feel that I have to do more than anybody else to be accepted into any social circle",
  "This was the pattern I unknowingly internalized for most of my life and my behavior was structured accordingly",
  "At that time my self-confidence was extremely low and suicide entered my mind more and more often",
  "I couldn\u2019t make any female friends and longed for someone I could confide in",
  "Every contact I had wound up sexual",
  "The absolutely crazy thing is that if a man didn\u2019t try to touch me, I felt rejected and unworthy",
  "Once I tried to confide in my mother",
  " I only told her about my uncle and begged for her protection",
  " That was before he died",
  "My Mother furiously slapped me in my face calling me a liar and a whore",
  " My uncle was right \u2013 nobody would believe me",
  "My mother told me that I was nothing special and should not expect anything out of the ordinary for my life",
  "I believed that too",
  "So, it really didn\u2019t matter what I was doing since I was unworthy of anything good, I was grateful for every little affection I could get from any man",
  "I often lived a secret life my parents were unaware of",
  "There was a time I enrolled in an all-boys soccer team",
  " I was just 11 years old and I played soccer using my one year older brother\u2019s name and was only exposed when my father unexpectedly came to a game",
  "I didn\u2019t know he was there because he never came to watch a game before",
  "I didn\u2019t see him at first and played an excellent game celebrated by my team",
  "These moments were the best in my childhood",
  "I had value",
  "I felt accepted and a bit admired",
  "Little that I knew this was my last game",
  "Of course, my father recognized his daughter right away when watching the game and forbade me to return to the team",
  "Later he told me that he was proud of me and disappointed in his son who didn\u2019t have any interest in doing sports",
  " He asked me not to say anything to my mother or brother",
  "I had no clue what he was talking about but was happy that he seems to like me the way I was",
  "When my father insisted that I minded my mother and became a girl wearing dresses, I felt betrayed by him, because I thought he understood me better",
  "But my father was a weak man who was terrified of my mother\u2019s moods and tried not to aggravate her",
  "He actually brought her flowers every weekend for as long as I can remember",
  "Most of his free time he spent in his workshop, a little shed in the backyard",
  "At one point, my mother installed an intercom to keep check with what he was doing",
  "My father didn\u2019t fight for himself",
  "He always told me to show love to my mother \u2018even though\u2019 she was very difficult to love",
  "I didn\u2019t trust, nor respected men",
  "No matter what their position in life and as big and strong they pretended to be for everybody to see when in bed, they were weak, pitiful, and dependent",
  "I learned that I had power in some situations and sometimes I used it to manipulate the men in my life in order to be spared their advantages towards me",
  "I pretended to be excited when they masturbated and that is what they did at times",
  " I had to be naked but tried not to be touched while they were busy with themselves",
  "At least we didn\u2019t have the dreaded intercourse",
  "The most disgusting times were when they shoved their penis into my mouth",
  "I got sick afterward every time",
  "I often wondered if every woman have to go through this",
  "It just didn\u2019t feel right",
  " No male encounter in my young life had anything to do with LOVE",
  " That\u2019s what I learned much too early in my life",
  "One Sunday, I was about 12 or 13 years old, my brother played with me his favorite hurtful game called muscle riding",
  "He forced me onto my back, pinned me down with his knees riding on my biceps",
  "It was very painful and so I cried out loud",
  "The door opened and my mother looked at us with an icy expression, then called us \u2018pigs\u2019",
  "I didn\u2019t quite understand but felt very dirty and despised",
  "I had no real friends",
  " Girls usually didn\u2019t like me, because I didn\u2019t know what to do with them, and so I ran around with boys most of the time",
  "My school clothes were mostly made out of my mother\u2019s old dresses and skirts",
  "My grandmother, who still lived in East Germany, sent sometimes packages with pretty material, so my mother could sew me a nice dress for school",
  "\u2018Oma\u2019 (my grandmother) was the only person in my life who genuinely cared for me, and I loved her fiercely",
  "My mother thought the fabric was too good for me, so she took some of her old dresses to convert into school clothes and used the new material for herself because she had to look good when going to work",
  " All I learned was \u201cthat I was not deserving or good enough\u201d",
  "One time, at age 14, I turned to my Pastor, hoping for guidance and some kind of protection",
  "I was so wrong about the church",
  "He was in his late 30th and had young children of his own",
  "The man I perceived as \u201choly\u201d, my Pastor, who had a girl in my class, he tried to comfort me with more physical attention",
  " He gave me afterward a validation of my role in this life when he insisted that it was me who made men do this",
  " It was my fault",
  "He told me that I tempted and teased men into a sexual rage and that it was not their fault if they lose control",
  "Men are just like that, they couldn\u2019t help it",
  "It never felt right but I was taught to use my body to communicate with men",
  "I never accepted any gifts; not even an ice cream from any of these men, because my father said once that if women accept gifts from a man she is not related or married to, they are considered a whore",
  " So, maybe my mother was right and I am a whore",
  "One thing I was sure of &#8211; It was entirely my fault \u2013 all of it",
  "I absolutely believed that",
  "How could I not",
  " My role in this life was reinforced regularly by so many people who supposed to love me",
  "That was most confusing to me because I wasn\u2019t sure what love was",
  "Who could I have asked",
  "There was no one I could tell",
  " Much to my mother\u2019s dismay, I was cute, pretty, and witty",
  "When people pointed out to her how pretty or smart I was, my mother made sure that this would not go to my head by denying the compliments and insisting that I was nothing special \u2013 in front of me",
  "I only remember one time my mother actually attempted with me role-playing where she was the child and me the mother",
  "So, Mutti was laying on the bed pretending to be the child, and let me play out my role as mother by allowing me to cut a bun into little slices to feed her with",
  " I smothered the little slices with strawberry jam when the jar slipped out of my hands onto the carpeted floor",
  "That was the end of our playtime",
  "I got spanked, told me that I am truly not good for anything, and I had to stay in for the rest of the day in cleaning my room",
  "She made sure I understood that people are not genuine when they gave me compliments",
  "It was all part of the social game, so she said",
  "I believed her and still don\u2019t know how to accept kind words about me from other people",
  "My mother was a constant ticking time bomb and we never knew when she would explode",
  " Being alone with my brother all week was definitely more desirable than spending one day with my mother",
  "I know, this sounds cruel, but it was the way we truly felt",
  "Today, I realize that my mother must have had some severe emotional problems and couldn\u2019t help herself",
  "Sometimes I feared that I had inherited whatever she had",
  "Papa, on the other hand, had some pride in my resilience",
  "Our connection during my early childhood was much better than with any other family member",
  " Whatever a father usually does with his son, he did with me",
  "My brother was not interested in much of what a typical boy would do",
  "Papa taught me how to hang wallpaper, work with tools in his shed, and how to be thrifty and creative at the same time",
  " He showed me, emotional love, sometimes \u2013 much to my mother\u2019s dismay",
  "Sometimes he would protect me from my mother\u2019s rage and expose himself to the danger zone",
  "I loved these rare and glorious moments because I felt loved",
  " The payback came often promptly in form of something my mother wanted me to do, and what placed some distance between my father and me",
  "When it came to special events, there was always a good reason not to celebrate my birthday",
  "During all of my childhood, I got to celebrate my birthday only twice",
  " The other times I was told that I was not deserving because of something I did",
  "For example, it was my dream to own a bicycle \u2013 even a used one",
  " My parents promised 7 times that I would get one either for Easter, Christmas, or my birthday if I would bring home good grades, or keep the house always clean and organized, or just be a good girl \u2013 whatever that meant",
  "Obviously, I was never deserving even though I always brought home good grades",
  "Well, maybe the house wasn\u2019t as spotless as my mother wanted it to be",
  "The bottom line is that I never owned a bicycle during my childhood",
  "Christmas was not much different",
  "Usually, my mother would collect my doll and carriage for several holidays, painted the carriage, sewed a new blanket, and clothing for the doll",
  " That was my gift",
  "I would like to make it known that I didn\u2019t play with dolls at all",
  " I was a Tomboy, more interested in my brother&#8217;s building kit which he sometimes would share with me",
  "There were good times too",
  " Especially when my mother was gone for a few days",
  "In the streets, I was a rebel, and not many kids would mess with me",
  "My brother had not discovered his strength and self-defense yet",
  " He had a lot of fears",
  "I was the one fighting for him",
  "I remember age 8 a special incidence when my mother and brother were gone for the weekend and I was alone with my dad",
  "He allowed me to go outside to play with the other kids",
  "Most of the kids I hung out with were older boys \u2013 like age 10 to 12",
  "They tolerated me because I had the courage and amazing ideas for street games",
  "As most kids respected me, they didn\u2019t think much of my brother, and when one of the boys didn\u2019t stop trash-talking my brother, I snapped, jumped the boy, tackled him to the ground, and bend his arm to his back when I heard a loud crack",
  "The boy wailed out loud and I instinctively knew that I had broken his arm",
  "I run back to our house and told my father everything because I expected the boy\u2019s parents would come over and let my father know what I did anyway",
  "I never forget how I loved my dad for his response",
  "He didn\u2019t punish me right away but told me to go to my room and put on my Sunday dress and shoes and fix my hair with a sweet bow",
  "Then, he wanted me to wait in my room and think about what I did until he would call me downstairs",
  "I was so frightened about what was to come",
  "Surely I expected a beating at the least",
  "When the doorbell rang several hours later, I cracked open my door to see and hear what happen",
  "Sure enough, there was a large man with a very red face, and the boy I hurt with his arm in a cast",
  "The man insisted that my brother had broken his son\u2019s arm and there will be hell to pay",
  "My father kept his cool at all times and just told him very friendly that his son and wife are out of town for the weekend, so it was impossible that he could have done anything he was accused of",
  "The man looked puzzled at his boy who then whispered to him that it was a girl who had done this to him",
  "The man hesitated a moment and accusingly shouted at my father that his older daughter had hurt his only 12-year-old son",
  "He wanted to go on about what kind of parents let a girl that age run around with younger boys",
  "My father told him to hold on for a moment, turned toward the stairs, and called for me",
  " And here I was coming down the stairs, cute as a button with white knee-high\u2019s, a little skirt with the petticoat peeking out underneath, and two large bows holding together my pigtails",
  "Startled the man looked at me and then at my father and asked if I was his only daughter, and he wanted to know how old I was",
  "When he learned that I was merely 8 years old and that there was no other girl in our family, he apologized profoundly, turned around, and slapped his poor boy in his face",
  "On the way out he looked back at my father asking him never to mention anything to anyone",
  "When they were gone, my father just told me to change out of my dress and come back to help him with some shores",
  "He also asked me not to tell anyone about this, not even my mother",
  "I was so proud to have a secret with Papa",
  "Throughout the rest of the day, I gladly helped my father without complaining and he made me promise to never ever hurt another kid again like that",
  "I promised, but I also thought about how unfair it was that others hurt me without anyone ever knew about it",
  "My brother was unique, to say the least",
  "Because he was teased in school, he practiced his fantasy fight moves on me, his little sister",
  "I was not allowed to complain to my parents about it, it was categorized as tattle-telling and that was not tolerated",
  "So, I invented some protective moves for myself if I couldn\u2019t get away from his attacks",
  " I loved the school",
  "It was like a vacation, every time",
  " I was allowed to be a kid",
  "After school, I had the responsibilities of an adult",
  "Planning, cooking, cleaning often took the entire afternoon, and my homework was done in school",
  "Though I was highly dyslexic, which nobody knew at that time, I was very smart and always found ways to cover up a learning disability",
  "I made learning look mostly easy for me then",
  "It definitely wasn\u2019t easy for my brother",
  "Whatever he started, I finished",
  "When he wanted to learn chess, for example, I beat him in every game",
  "He wanted to learn ping pong and I was chosen to play for the school team",
  "In the end, my parents forbade me to compete in anything my brother wanted to do, so he would not be discouraged by my \u2018easy does it\u2019 attitude",
  "When I was 12, I was accepted as a babysitter for some children in the neighborhood",
  "I made a little pocket money during this time, and my parents insisted that I use that money to purchase school stuff",
  "I had to justify every penny and was not allowed to keep any money for myself",
  "One day, when I babysat for a 2-year-old girl who was raised by her grandmother, I stole money out of the wallet I found in the kitchen and hid the empty wallet under the kitchen sink",
  "It was a few days prior to my 13th birthday",
  "The next day, the old woman came to speak with my parents who then cross-examined me about the missing wallet",
  "I didn\u2019t admit to anything at that time but still was banned from all outside activities besides school",
  "On my birthday, the old woman came over and delivered a large cake for me",
  " My favorite",
  "My parents asked me to come down from my room and thank the women for her cake",
  "I felt deeply ashamed and as a punishment, my parents made me eat that entire cake all by myself &#8211; in one sitting",
  "It was a lesson I never forgot",
  " (I still have a sweet tooth though)After that incident, I started helping the old woman with whatever she needed and never accepted a penny for it",
  "Of course, she found her wallet and knew right away that only I could have taken the money",
  "She never talked about it, and several years later when I asked her, she told me that she saw my remorse and thought it was enough to forgive me",
  "I was humbled",
  "She was the first person who was genuinely kind to me, and she taught me a very valuable lesson about my conscience",
  "I absolutely love sweets and my obsession with sweets found many avenues to be satisfied",
  " The most memorable incident was when I was about 12",
  "Every Christmas, my father brought home several large beautifully decorated candy boxes that he had received from customers",
  " He gave these boxes to my mother who kept them in their liquor cabinet which was off-limit to us children",
  "On the back of the boxes were pictures with incredibly delicious and tempting looking chocolates \u2013 however, we were told that these sweets were for adults only",
  "Sometimes, when a box was empty, I was allowed to use it for personal treasures such as pictures I collected",
  "I was 12 years old and curious as a kitten and I felt it was time to find out what the mystique behind the chocolates in these boxes was",
  "My parents were both at work and my brother was playing outside with his friends",
  "Perfect timing",
  "",
  "I quickly chose the largest most beautiful box, decorated with a \u201cdripping\u201d heart, a red rose, and lots of glitters",
  "My heart was pounding with excitement and maybe a tingle of fear when I very carefully removed the plastic slip around the box, making sure it didn\u2019t break",
  "I worked fast, not allowing my conscience to interfere with the upcoming pleasure",
  "I would deal with that later",
  "And here it was \u2013 finally \u2013 24 chocolates, we called them \u201cPralines\u201d, beautifully decorated arranged in little golden molds &#8211; and they were all mine \u2013 at least that\u2019s what I wanted to think",
  "I quickly bit into the first piece and savored its unusual but not unpleasant taste",
  " Most of them had a strong but sweet-tasting liquid gushing into my mouth as soon as I took a bite",
  "This must be the way a grown-up feels",
  " I had seen the ladies on TV lying on the chaise eating out of a box just like it",
  "So, I did the same",
  "I pretended to be one of these ladies and felt quite grown up eating each and all of the chocolates",
  "  My head started feeling a bit funny, and I quickly got to work covering up my theft",
  "I was always very inventive and so, as a substitute for the candies, I dropped a large Hazelnut in each of the golden compartments then carefully slipped the wrapping back onto the box",
  "I believe I slept for the rest of the day and since this was unusual for me, my parents thought that I was sick and forgave me that my chores were not done that day",
  "About a week before Christmas, my mother wanted to make a gift to a holiday function they had in her office",
  "Each person had to bring a gift for a colleague without the presenter to be known",
  "I heard her telling my father that she would gift the large box with the liquor chocolates and that she believed it to be a great hit",
  "You all might be able to guess what came next \u2013 well, my mother\u2019s colleague loved the box so much, she wanted to share with everyone in the office and opened it right there",
  "  To her amusement and surprise, there were no chocolates as expected and my mother remained anonymous with her gift",
  "When Mutti came home that night she was enraged and told my father about her experience",
  "  My father kept glancing at me suspiciously but there was no convicting evidence",
  "I thought I got away with it, especially when my father gave me my very first box of chocolates on Christmas Eve",
  "I eagerly opened it and to my surprise, it was filled with NUTS",
  "* * *Germany offers three different academic opportunities for a normally developed child",
  "There is the folk School with 9 years of basic education and additional vocational schooling",
  "Then, Middle School, with an 11-year curriculum and additional vocational schooling was possible for qualified students, as well as High School with 13 years of higher education, prepping a student for the University",
  "My parents didn\u2019t believe that girls needed that much of an education, so when the time came to be tested for higher education, I forged my parents&#8217; signature and was accepted",
  "I went to high school for six months before my parents found out about it",
  "They then accused me that my only motivation to go to high school was to spite my brother, who struggled in school",
  "Fortunately for me, my parents felt too embarrassed to take me out of school",
  "Maybe secretly they were even a bit proud since none of them had higher education",
  "The work for high school was a big load besides managing the household",
  " I struggled sometimes, but could not expect help from my parents",
  "My schoolwork caused a rip in the relationship I had with my father",
  " He was a simple man, unable to understand my homework, and often insisted that it was all \u201ccrap\u201d what we learned in school",
  "He argued with me about the curriculum and we started to disconnect as father and daughter",
  "At age 14, I moved to a protestant convent to live and work",
  " I wanted to leave home",
  "It was my choiceThe reason I left with my parent&#8217;s blessings still is unclear to me",
  "Maybe it was due to recent events during my mother\u2019s absence",
  "One day, my mother was on a spa trip, or health-supportive sanatorium, I was home alone and enjoyed rare freedom",
  "I forgot where my brother was",
  "My father went to a company event that evening, and I didn\u2019t expect him to be home until late",
  " Papa was not a heavy drinker and I only remember him drunk one time",
  "The scent of alcohol scared me",
  "He had a hobby wine cellar and enjoyed most evenings a glass of wine",
  "This evening something different happen",
  "I was already in bed asleep when I felt my father entering my bed",
  " I was shocked and quickly turned on my side facing the wall when I felt him and his hands",
  "Please forgive me if I don\u2019t want to go into details, but this was my Papa &#8211; I loved and respected him so much",
  "I thought of him as the ideal male",
  " After all, he did bring my mother flowers every weekend and he didn\u2019t leave her even though he wasn\u2019t happy",
  "My mother was not easy to love, and I experienced more than once when they were fighting",
  "My mother used to say that their fight was about me and that was my fault",
  "I truly believed that Papa loved me",
  " I felt comfortable cuddling with him",
  " He never touched me the way my uncle did",
  "Now, this was all gone",
  " My father turned out to be \u201cjust another guy\u201d",
  "After I turned away from him, Papa seems to come to his senses and quickly left my bedroom",
  "My world crumbled and everything had changed &#8211; once again",
  "We were unable to look at each other the same way as before",
  " I had lost my father for good",
  "To his defense, I know that he was suffering severely about what he did and regretted it very much",
  " His hair turned white within weeks",
  "Unfortunately, the bond was broken and never completely healed",
  "I believe he understood why I wanted to leave the house and live somewhere else",
  "I am sure he didn\u2019t want a reminder of that incident living in his home",
  "The convent, I went to, offered many different experiences",
  "During the weekdays, we attended school as usual",
  " During the weekend we had to earn our keep and work either in the hospital or the living quarters of the Deaconesses",
  "The ministry of a deaconess is, in modern times, a non-ordained ministry for women in some Protestant churches to provide pastoral care, especially for other women",
  "These women were like protestant nuns",
  " They did not marry",
  "It was my job, during my first year there, to clean their rooms so impeccably, that not even a shade of dust could be seen on the white gloves when they came for inspection",
  "Though it was tedious, I still enjoyed this work",
  "Most rooms were decorated with fine furniture and exquisite artwork",
  " No one bothered me and I felt safe for the first time in a long time",
  "One day during cleaning, one of the Deaconess came to her room",
  "She gently closed the door and asked me to stay when I attempted to leave",
  " She complimented me on my work and kept caressing my face, shoulders, and back, and told me to relax",
  " She told me that she loved my tender skin and for relaxation, she insisted to give me a whole-body massage",
  "Of course, it was not just a massage",
  "So, I learned that some women are just like men",
  "I also learned that the church was not a refuge",
  "I was called several more times into her room and was just relieved that she didn\u2019t ask anything in return",
  "I was only 14 and came to this place for protection",
  "The longer I was around, the more I learned how I was expected to be",
  "It seemed to be different from other girls",
  "They acted all confident and happy, and I tried to be like them",
  "It didn\u2019t work out though \u2013 I could not disguise my own opinion about who I was",
  "Somehow, I was unable to connect to any of the other girls and didn\u2019t make any friends except with one girl who was like me with a similar background",
  "She never directly told me, but it seems to be true without words",
  "Her behavior was similar to mine",
  " Because men gave us much needed attention, we gave them what they wanted",
  "This followed me throughout my entire life",
  "In movies, there were men courting women, respecting, and spoiling them",
  "These were another kind of woman and I was not like them at all",
  "These were good and deserving women and I was not",
  "I never quite understood why and tried to copy these kinds of females",
  "I wasn\u2019t a very convincing copy, because I still had the same experiences with men most of my life",
  "They just were interested in one thing about me",
  "By the age of 18, I got tired to play the role of a victim and tried to end my life twice",
  "We all do what we do best and I attracted the best victors in my life and prompted abuse if it didn\u2019t come strong enough from my abusers",
  " This was my NORMAL",
  "Maybe that was an accomplishment in itself",
  "My past had turned into a behavioral pattern of self-destruction",
  "I didn\u2019t know how to be \u2013 period",
  "I made sure that I destroyed every promising relationship because I didn\u2019t feel deserving and knew that nobody would want to stay with me anyway",
  "So, when I was old enough to choose my own life adventures, I continued to walk the only path I knew",
  "Though I knew that there was something much better and worthwhile to reach for, I just was convinced that the good stuff was not for me",

  "Sometimes, when I met new people, I manufactured a story of my life, in which I came from an upper-class environment with kind and generous parents in the hope of respect from men and women",
  "With most of the people, it didn\u2019t take",
  "I could not hide from what I thought I was",
  "For most of my life, I just never truly believed that good things were meant for me",
  "I was told by my family that I was not deserving of anything good, because I was no good",
  "I was told by my teacher that nothing worthwhile will ever become of me",
  "Though I was in popular demand helping to prepare and serve at parties, I was never invited as a guest, never had friends who included me into their lives, and everything people said to me seemed to validate my lack of worthiness",
  "At least that is what I believed most of the time",
  "My father used to tell me that I was like a Jo-Jo, always bouncing right back \u2013 I often wished that he would understand me better",
  "Amazingly, I never gave up trying to find a reason for being and hoped someone would recognize that I did have value",
  "Unfortunately, the most important person who needed to recognize my value was me \u2013 I just could not see it at the time",
  " I thought I had to do something to be of value but never knew what it was",
  "I sometimes still find myself getting out of my way to prove my worth \u2013 often without self-consideration",
  " As soon as I could read, I learned to live my life through books",
  "The creativity of my mind was my joy \u2013 but also my curse",
  "I was good at many things, but never exceptional at one \u2013 so I thought",
  "The lack of money seemed to play a huge role in my failures \u2013 at least that is what I told myself",
  "Today I know that my lack of self-love and trust in worthiness was initiating my thoughts and behavior",
  "In school I used my communication skills and fearless approach to defend others, hoping to make friends",
  "I never did",
  "I didn\u2019t fit in",
  "I became class president, but still was never part of any group or actions",
  "I always tried to find new ways to belong and became known for advocating for those who could not speak up for themselves",
  "These activities got me some attention occasionally and I believed that I had found my way into society by rescuing the weaker and the needy",
  "At least it took me away from my own problems and made me feel a certain value about myself",
  " It also made me incredibly resourceful and strong",
  "However, when I was not busy solving other people\u2019s problems, I felt exceedingly shy and thought of myself as a total misfit without a purpose",
  "I didn\u2019t recognize at that point in my life that I suffered from depression, PTSD, and anxiety",
  "When my mother suggested that I had fat and ugly thighs and should be ashamed of being seen in a bathing suit at age 15, I stopped going swimming in public",
  "I became self-conscious and my self-esteem was very low",
  "The only thing I was good at for others was sex; even though I really never enjoyed it and was glad when it was over \u2013 every time",
  "My biggest reward was in a hug or embrace after sex, making me believe for a brief moment that I was loved, appreciated, and wanted",
  "  Because I trained my attention on other people\u2019s problems, I wanted to become a doctor after graduating from High School",
  "Even though I know today that I had undiagnosed dyslexia, I had the scores qualifying me to be enrolled into medical school",
  "However, my parents felt that I, as a girl, should approach a more \u201cpractical\u201d and fitting occupation, since I was expected to marry someday and higher education was perceived as a \u201cwaste\u201d",
  " Also, they didn\u2019t think that I was smart enough to become a doctor",
  "One time, Mutti screamed at me that I must think of myself to be better than her, and that is why I wanted a higher education",
  "Well, I then became a nurse, hoping to have value to people weaker than me",
  "No matter how hard I worked trying to fit in, I was unable to connect with my fellow nurses, as we had nothing in common",
  "It seemed to me that I was not good enough for anybody",
  "Still, I enjoyed being a nurse",
  "I was an excellent nurse",
  "I seemed to have a niche for it, and the gratitude from my patients lifted my spirit, supporting the idea that I was good for something",
  "Being a nurse gave me a purpose",
  "Unfortunately and unexpectedly, my compassionate demeanor towards my patients was heavily criticized by my head nurses, because we were not supposed to spent time with a patient holding hands, consoling and listening",
  "It was our role to take blood, administer therapy, make their beds, and hand out medications in the quickest and most efficient way",
  "I just didn\u2019t agree with that vision",
  "Shortly before my State exam, I met my first husband",
  "He was incredibly handsome and I was desperate to feel loved by somebody",

  "His widowed mother made space in her living room for us to sleep together, and when I got pregnant, she threw me out screaming at me that she only wanted that her son had some fun so he would get over the failure of his first marriage",
  "She wanted me to be her son\u2019s whore",
  " My parents insisted that we got married before the child was born, and so I was married, passed my state exams, and gave birth at age 20 \u2013 all within six month",
  "The wedding was not memorable and I have really nothing to remember the event by",
  "I saw this marriage as a chance for a new life \u2013 a new beginning \u2013 a new me",
  "I wanted to be the best wife I could be and hoped that this was my chance to create a harmonious and save home environment",
  "So, I cooked, cleaned, washed, and made a beautiful home trying to create a harmonious and happy environment for my little family",
  "I had it all figured out in my head",
  "My mother was appalled and embarrassed by the thought of becoming a grandmother so early in her life mostly concerned of what her friends would say",
  " My father was quite supportive looking forward having a grandbaby",
  "Unfortunately, my husband could not get over his first wife (who ironically had the same name as mine)",
  "He worked long hours every day and stopped sleeping in our bed",
  "Now, I was taught since early childhood what my role as a woman was; so, being rejected by my husband made me feel isolated and unworthy \u2013 once again",
  "I still fought with all I got to make this marriage work",
  "My first baby was a girl and I called her Michaela",
  "Two years later I had another baby and got pregnant again when my boy was only three months old",
  "I called my second baby Christian and loved him with all my heart",
  "I swore that I would teach my boy to be a better man, a man who treated every women with respect and would never force himself on anyone",
  "Just before my third baby was due, my Christian got sick with an unidentified virus and died in my arms within 24 hours, losing all of his body fluids",
  "My mother accused me, that being a nurse, I could have prevented that, and I bought into her point of view that this was my fault",
  "There was not much time for mourning, because the day I buried my little boy, I went into labor and my third baby was born",
  "I don\u2019t remember much of all this time, because it seemed to be so surreal and I was totally numb",
  "I gave birth to another baby boy and named him Michael",
  "Eleven days after Michael was born, I was released from the hospital",
  "My husband had asked me to wait with the baby outside the entrance while he was getting the car",
  "So, I waited with baby Michael tucked into a large soft down pillow when a drunk driver lost control of his car and drove directly into me and the baby",
  "Three weeks later when I regained conscience at the hospital, I was told that Michael had died instantly",
  "I got away with some broken ribs and a broken heart and mind",
  "My mother pointed out that it was irresponsible of me to have stood there",
  "I carried that guilt throughout my entire life",
  "Three years later, we filed for divorce, because I had a hard time overcoming depression",
  "I was no longer fun for my husband",
  "During the seventies in Germany, a divorce was only granted if a fault was determined",
  "Of course, I assumed responsibility for the failure of this marriage and not only lost all support from my family, I also lost my firstborn baby girl",
  "Because the failure of the marriage was considered my fault, I was determined to be an unfit mother",
  "I broke into many pieces and again lost reasons to live",
  "***For many years I tried to attach myself to other people and families; however nobody wanted me to be part of their life after the novelty of the new wore out",
  "I had far too much baggage and that was not very attractive for anyone to live with \u2013 not even myself",
  "I found proof of this when I got involved with a man I worked with",
  " He was so different \u2013 successful and enterprising",
  "It was so exciting to be with someone like him and after I got my divorce, I move into his home",
  " He owned a grocery store and together we started a charter airline",
  "I became a true entrepreneur and felt more confident than ever before",
  "I worked at least 14 hours per day to make our venture a success and to proof my worth to him",
  " For my work I received 10% ownership of his company",
  "I felt that my life finally changed for the better, and when he ask me to have a child with him, I was more than willing to grant his wish",
  "In my devotion and fear of losing him, I made sure I got pregnant quickly to give him this gift of trust and love",
  "We decorated the baby\u2019s room, purchased furniture and clothing",
  "Everything we did, we did with a happy heart",
  " It was an incredible time and I felt totally save in his arms",
  "For the very first time ever I felt valued",
  "Things changed drastically during the first trimester of my pregnancy",
  "I was in physical agony due to a pinch of my sciatic nerve and moving around became incredibly difficult",
  "As a result, I could not work as hard as I did before",
  "More and more evenings I was home alone while he went out with friends",
  "One night, he didn\u2019t come home until 5 AM and I was up all night full of worry what could have happened",
  "When he entered the room, my stomach felt in knots, because everything about him seemed different",
  "He looked at me coldly and told me that he had changed his mind about me and the baby and told me to leave his house",
  "He had reconciled with his former wife and expected her to move back in with him the very same day",
  "When I didn\u2019t comprehend what was happened, he called my father and asked him to pick me up",
  "I just stood there totally numb and couldn\u2019t believe his words",
  "I thought this all to be a bad dream",
  "When I didn\u2019t move, he got out some boxes and suitcases and packed some of my stuff",
  " He then pushed me and my suitcase out of the door and called for my father to pick me up",
  "He then locked the door behind me",
  "Later, my father insisted that this man will fly with me to England where abortions were legal up to 6 months",
  "I was numb and followed directions given to me",
  " So, we went to London and I had the most horrifying experience of my life",
  "This was worse than any abuse I had endured before",
  "I never gotten over this experience",
  "When we returned, my father went to see the man and came back with an agreement for me to sign away my 10% of our company in exchange for 10,000 Mark",
  "That night I left my parents\u2019 house and kept driving for several days without knowing where to go",
  "I just could no longer listen to my mother accusing me that once again I screwed up and embarrassed her in front of friends and neighbors",
  "I missed my firstborn baby girl desperately, but was unable to see or hold her",
  " Much drama and despair came along whenever I tried to see her",
  " I constantly thought about the baby I aborted and felt that I could never be worthy of anything ever again",
  "Finally, I moved to Hannover, about 200 miles away and found a position as an RN at the Medical High School",
  "With the job came a little apartment on campus and I started life over again",
  "I was very up-and-coming teaching home dialysis to patients and doctors",
  "My supervisor was a 30 year old successful woman who befriended me",
  "I was so happy and proud that someone like her wanted to be friends with me",
  " She invited me to her home and we spent many fun hours together after work",
  "One night it had gotten late and I had a few drinks with her, so I stayed over for the first time",
  "It felt natural for me to share the only bed with her, but not so natural what followed",
  "She started caressing me and got very demanding for me to participate",
  "I instantly sobered, but faked to be more drunk just wanting to sleep",
  "She finally gave up",
  "The next day I tried to explain that I was not interested in women that way",
  "She got very angry, said that I had mislead her, and our work relationship became difficult",
  "The friendship was over",
  "I started to avoid her as much as possible, however, she was my superior and I had to deal with that",
  "Eventually, I quit my job and moved away because the pressure was too much to bear",
  "* * *Whenever I was looking for a relationship, I searched for a true connection, because I was incredibly lonely",
  "I had no roots, no friends, and no love \u2013 only work",
  "It was easy enough to get a man interested in me, as I was blessed with attractive looks and at first glance had a positive, vibrant and outgoing personality",
  "Still, I sabotaged every single possibility for a relationship pushing for quick validation that I was indeed not worthy to be with, when secretly I was craving for someone fighting for me to stay",
  "Men looked at me as entertainment, but not wife material",
  " I did not know how to be that",
  "I questioned my reason for living and had tried to end my life many times",
  "Astonishingly, there was something making me get up every morning and search for my place in life",
  "I was never afraid to change towns, states, and even countries in hope to find \u201chome\u201d what I called it",
  "I wasn\u2019t quite sure what that concept of home entitled",
  "I was only 25 years of age when I decided to move to Canada",
  "I didn\u2019t know a soul in this country and my decision was made by turning the globe with my eyes closed when my finger pointed to Newfoundland",
  "Nobody seem to care for me in Germany",
  "Maybe it will be different in another country, where people didn\u2019t know that I wasn\u2019t worthy",
  "I purchased international newspapers and searched for job offers in Newfoundland",
  "Only a month later I responded to an inquiry for an Au Pair girl and got the job",
  "Moving was not an easy undertaking, and the immigration part alone was difficult and at some point humiliating",
  "It took two months to qualify and I felt almost special when I was accepted",
  "I was so excited to have a chance to start all over again in a country where nobody knew me",
  " This was an opportunity to reinvent my life and start belonging to someone or something good",
  "The family who had hired me picked me up at the airport in Saint Johns, Newfoundland",
  "They had 5 children between the ages of 4 to 12, and lived very isolated in a rural area",
  "I was given a small room about 9\u2019 x 9\u2019, with a bed, a stool and a nightstand",
  "In the hallway was an amour for my belongings and I had to share the bathroom with the children",
  "It was my job to get up at 5 AM, prepare the breakfast, get the children ready for school, clean up their rooms, wash their clothes, clean the rest of the house, wash the clothes of the parents, prepare lunch, clean the kitchen again, pick up the children from the bus stop, oversee their homework, prepare dinner, serve dinner to the children, then later cater dinner parties for the parents",
  "I worked 6 \u00bd days per week, 12 hours per day, never sat with the family at the table, and all I got paid was $ 25 per week",
  "There was really nowhere to go on my half-day off, because I didn\u2019t have transportation and we lived in the country",
  "Personal conversations did not exist and most of my communication was with the children, or receiving orders from their mother",
  "I was incredible lonely and felt more and more depressed",
  "Once again, I was validated as not worthy to be part of a family",
  "Though I loved serving people, I didn\u2019t wanted to be merely a servant",
  "After 6 months, I took the $ 600 I had earned, packed my bag and left the family hitchhiking to the nearest motel",
  "Since nobody was interested to know a person with emotional baggage, I kept pretending to be a tough woman who is always happy and has no needs or worries",
  "People enjoyed being with me, they just would not take me home to be part of their lives",
  "I guess they must have seen through the con and figured that I simply wasn\u2019t good enough",
  "Everybody had somewhere to go and someone to be with",
  "I did not",
  "Holidays were especially difficult and I tried to avoid them as much as I could",
  "Nobody got to know me, and I felt that nobody really cared to",
  "But then, I didn\u2019t know myself either",
  "I started working all kind of jobs in Newfoundland and gave it my all with whatever I did",
  "I could not do anything without giving 100%+, and my co-workers didn\u2019t like to be around me",
  "I messed with their speed of work by being too fast and efficient",
  " Most people I knew didn\u2019t like their jobs, or cared for what they did for a living",
  " I always did what I could to make any job interesting and creative",
  "I became more and more a loner \u2013 even though I longed to belong",
  "People embraced me quickly and let me go quickly",
  " Something about me made them see that I was presenting a facade",
  "Some people found my life interesting and took me on as something like a mascot until they gotten tired of me",
  "I was a great toy to many men, but as soon as I became human, they lost interest",
  "Nobody knew my story, and I was too ashamed to share it",
  "I traveled extensively and adventurously &#8211; secretly always on a hunt to find a home, someone who wanted me and someone I could trust",
  "Today I know that I didn\u2019t even trusted myself and that was my downfall",
  "At times I found it strange that I wanted \u2013 no needed- to trust a man",
  "I wanted to proof to myself and the world that there are decent men in this world",
  "I was so desperate to be loved for who I was",
  "Today I understand that I really didn\u2019t know who I was and I was searching for someone to love me better than I did",
  "With every relationship, when I laid my heart to his disposal, I was disposed of",
  "I fell in love easily and dreamed to finally have found a home",
  " I always believed all promises men told me just to get me into their bed",
  "I wanted to believe \u2013 I needed to believe",
  "I mastered lovemaking to keep men interested and hoped I would become indispensable to them",
  "My desperation to be wanted or needed, destroyed everything over and over again, validating that I was just not a keeper \u2013 not good enough",
  "I didn\u2019t like sex, however was willing to pay with it for a night of embrace where I could dream to be in safe and loving arms",
  "I NEVER took any money or presents from any man and felt that differentiated me from the women working in the streets",
  "One of the men I trusted, invited me to a romantic evening at his place where he put drugs into my tea",
  "He then had other men come to the bedroom to have sex with me",
  "Not having ever used any drugs to this point, I totally collapsed and started crying for 3 days",
  " I just couldn\u2019t stop sobbing loudly",
  "He feared I had serious problems from the drugs and dropped me in front of a hospital leaving in a hurry",
  "The doctors at the hospital let me sleep off the effects of the drugs and then released me",
  "I had nowhere to go",
  "My room was no longer available and my belongings were gone",
  "All I had was my passport",
  "That night I slept in a homeless shelter and found myself to have only two choices; live or die",
  "Once again I chose to live and got myself a job at a restaurant the very next day",
  " I found a second job as a night clerk for a cheap motel and with that a room to stay in",
  "Very quickly I established some financial stability and decided that if I wanted a family, I had to create my own",
  "So I wanted to have a baby and searched for a healthy, good looking, and talented man to father my child without planning a marriage",
  "I didn\u2019t want to be discarded again and made sure that there were no emotional strings attached",
  "It was then when I met a charming French Canadian musician",
  "I liked him a lot, but was sure to hide my feelings until I got pregnant",
  "It was not easy to leave him after I got pregnant, but I was sure that this was the only way to avoid additional pain",
  "I moved to the suburban of Montr\u00e9al, Canada where I applied for a live-in position with a former German woman who ran a house caring for several older people",
  "It was at this point the ideal solution for me and my baby",
  " She knew about the pregnancy and vouched to support me",
  "She even offered me to stay on after the baby was born",
  " I felt secure for the first time in a long time and worked hard to be worthy of this opportunity",
  "Pregnancy was long and very lonely for me",
  "One day I met a German man who was very attracted to me even in my now visible condition",
  " He offered his company, which I accepted",
  "We took long walks, played board games, and bonded as friends",
  "I didn\u2019t feel anything more than friendship and gratitude for this man",
  "Anyway, his parents wholeheartedly disapproved of me",
  " They didn\u2019t like my \u201cbohemian\u201d outlook on life and the fact that I am an unwed mother to be",
  "Social services visited with me and wanted to convince me to abort this child, because I was a single mother",
  "There was no way I would give up my baby \u2013 no one could take away my chance of having my very own family",
  "The birth of my son was awfully long and painful, and we both almost died afterwards",
  "My friend visited often",
  "He must have enjoyed his role so much, that he put his name as the father on the birth certificate without my knowledge or consent",
  "Surely, he meant well, but I did not have that kind of relationship with him",
  "Our friendship ended soon after",
  "A week after I brought my baby boy home, I developed a breast infection and high fever",
  "I couldn\u2019t feed my baby, nor could I get out of bed to the telephone",
  " My breasts were hard as rocks and the pain was unbearable",
  "I had to listen to my newborn scream for hunger and could do nothing",
  "I endured 2 days of this and had made peace with not surviving, hoping my baby would not suffer too much",
  "Finally, my Neighbors heard my baby crying for hours and sent someone to break into my home when I didn\u2019t respond to their call",
  "They called an ambulance and fed my baby with formula I had from the hospital",
  "We both were in rough condition as I hadn\u2019t changed his diaper and was not able to go to the bathroom myself",
  "This was truly a very close call",
  "I worked and lived in this house for several months when the owner decided to sell it to another person who didn\u2019t had any use for me and needed the space for themselves",
  "I had only a month to find something else",
  "Inspired by the elder care, I rented a duplex \u2013 both sides and opened up a tri-lingual daycare center for small children",
  "I took in a pregnant girl from Ecuador to help me so I could attend classes for further education",
  "The center was profitable after only 3 months, so I enrolled myself into McGill University to study psychology because I wanted to learn how to fix myself for the sake of my baby boy",
  "I had not enough self-value to do this for myself",
  "I had no one else",
  "I kept very busy but felt very lonely at times",
  "I wanted family desperately, so I created one without considering the other side of the coin",
  "For now my son would not judge or discard me for many years to come",
  "He needed me \u2013 at least for now",
  "I had written to my parents about my baby and my mother wrote a long letter back describing why I was irresponsible and unworthy to be a mother; having two babies die on me",
  "She also felt I became an unwed mother just to spite her",
  " She felt ashamed to tell her friends",
  "The memory of how my first baby boy died kept creeping up on me and during the first year of my new son\u2019s life I never left his side in fear of something could happen to him as well",
  "I would not have been able to survive losing another baby",
  "He was so beautiful",
  "He was my joy",
  "Yes, I actually felt pure joy for the very first time in my life",
  "There was nobody who could take that away from me",
  "My business was only 7 months old when I was able to purchase the home and pay it off shortly thereafter",
  "I had a loyal high end customer base and added vacation service as well as other overnight events to my services",
  "Two girls trained in childcare, bi-and tri-lingual, which was a great asset to have",
  "I took on the night service, since it wasn\u2019t too demanding \u2013 most of the time anyway",
  "Life was good for us and I started to be a bit more trusting towards others",
  " I developed great friendships within the neighborhood",
  "When my son was little older than a year, I received a letter from my mother telling me that my father was very ill because I had given him too many reasons to worry",
  "She told me that I owed it to him to come home and care for him",
  "Loyalty and a great sense of responsibility define who I am on some level",
  "Some may say those are good trades to have",
  "So, I entrusted my home and business to a family I had befriended asking them to help with the sale of the house if I would not return",
  "Then I went back to Germany to care for my father",
  "It turned out that he didn\u2019t know that my mother had written about his illness and he was on his way to recover from a heart attack",
  "Back in Germany I quickly found a job in my profession as a nurse and rented an apartment for me and my son",
  "It was very difficult to adjust to the cultural differences I have gotten used to and was fond of",
  "The hospital had daycare and for the first time I was separated from my son for several hours each day leaving him with strangers",
  "I missed my life in Canada",
  "My father loved his grandson and demonstrated genuine pride to be my son\u2019s grandfather",
  " Papa plaid with the baby, took him out for walks and proudly showed him to his friends and neighbors",
  "And I have to admit, my mother did what she could to love him as well \u2013 even though he was in her mind a \u201cbastard\u201d",
  " In her own way, she adored the cuteness in my boy",
  "My house in Canada was sold by my friends; however, they felt that they deserve the money they got from the sale for their services and kept all the proceeds",
  "A Canadian lawyer I hired from the distance told me that I had to be present in Canada to pursue a successful lawsuit",
  "I could not afford to go back because all of my money was tied up in my home, and what cash I had, vanishing quickly",
  "I was tired of fighting and loosing",
  "I craved to have someone caring for me for a change",
  "So I started reading the personal ads in a national newspaper and answered some of them",
  "This was how I met my second husband",
  "We married after we knew each other only four months",
  " It seemed to be the right thing to do at the time",
  "He was nice, had a good job and was willing to care for my son and me",
  "I didn\u2019t believe that anyone could love me anyway, so I didn\u2019t expect too much for myself",
  "Shortly after the wedding I was diagnosed with stomach cancer and went through a series of exhausting treatments",
  "He lost interest in me quickly and told me that this was not what he envisioned",
  "After only six month of marriage we filed for divorce",
  "I did not ask for anything from him, and so the procedure was simple",
  "The cancer went into remission after an operation and the treatments, and I moved with my son back to the northern part of Germany where I grew up",
  "Luckily, within six month I was recruited to re-organize the largest private nursing home in northern Germany",
  " My professional knowledge and talent obviously was acknowledged by some people",
  "I felt hope inside me and let myself be excited again",
  "This was my new chance",
  "I absolutely loved this opportunity and thrived in my job",
  "For many months forgot all about me and my needs and focused on my career",
  "I re-organized the largest private nursing home in northern Germany",
  " It became a true success and the stepping stone to more ventures",
  "Then, my father was diagnosed with stomach cancer and colon cancer with a prognosis of only six months to live",
  "I divided my time between my work, my son and caring for my father",
  "My mother felt incapable to care for him, because she felt the need to prepare to be a widow",
  "After only one month, I collapsed at work and was diagnosed with uterus wall cancer",
  "Like with the stomach cancer, I refused any chemo treatments or radiation and treated myself with raw foods, isolation from emotional stress, and meditation",
  "My mother never knew about my condition and thought my weight loss was due to my work",
  " She actually encouraged me to lose more weight, because in her eyes I was always too fat",
  "I weight 120 lbs",
  " most of my adult life at 5\u20195\u201d height",
  "Even though I went through so much personal drama, my work was much appreciated and I received full support from the owners of the facility",
  "At one point I shared my condition with my dying father to encourage him to fight for his life",
  "He acted like he was almost glad to be that sick",
  "Papa found the courage to accuse my mother to be the reason for many personal losses in his life",
  "My father passed away 3 months later in my arms, making me promise that I would keep the family together and care for my mother",
  "During his last hours I called my brother to be with Papa one last time",
  "I was happy for Papa to have found peace",
  "Exhausted from the past months experiences, I asked friends to care for my son, while I had what was left of my tumor removed",
  "I went into remission once again and kept working at the nursing home",
  "My relationship with my mother seemed ok at this time",
  " She wanted me to take care of her as I did with my father",
  "However, I convinced her to get a driver\u2019s license and create a more independent life for herself \u2013 and me",
  "My father had requested that my brother and I give my mother our legal part of the inheritance, so my mother would have a comfortable life",
  "I totally accepted that while my brother was very angry not to get anything",
  "I returned to my own life after all was settled",
  "My work was very gratifying and successful covering the painful experiences of the past year",
  "For once I felt capable, needed and wanted",
  "After about ten months, the son of the owner told me that he was in love with me",
  "At this point I welcomed someone to help with my life and was full of hope to find happiness after all",
  "Unfortunately, his parents did not approve and the situation became very complicated",
  " I was released from my work right after my initial contract ended",
  " We decided to move to another part in Germany and start over again by purchasing a small hotel in the Bavarian Forest thinking, that this way, I could have my son around me and didn\u2019t need strangers taking care of him",
  "My son was my world and I could love him unconditionally without fear of being judged or rejected",
  "The day we had signed the purchase agreements for the hotel with the bank, I became a victim of a car accident and as a result I was unable to walk",
  "My right femur was fractured, I had a middle face fracture, my jaw was broken, and my rib cage was crashed",
  " I was told that I would not walk again",
  "I could not accept the prognosis, and motivated by my vision for a new life, I went to a facility with doctors specialized in such injuries to fight for what I wanted to be",
  "I gave myself three month to recover and worked with Olympic trainers 12 agonizing hours each day, supervised by sports doctors",
  "Failure was not an option for me",
  "During this time my focus was on recovery to start my future life with my son, my partner and the hotel",
  "I did it",
  "Still on crotches, I renovated the hotel doing much of the labor myself as my partner was not very handy",
  "After the Grand Opening, I was able to take my then 14 year old daughter back into my care, because her father did not know how to handle her in her teenage years any longer, and wanted to place her into a facility for troubled youth",
  "I had prayed for the day to see my firstborn again and celebrated when I could picked her up from the train station",
  "She was so beautiful",
  "Very carefully I started to develop a relationship with her and my life seemed to be complete",
  "After only two months, I found my partner looking at my daughter inappropriately and my world crumbled",
  "Nothing had any meaning anymore",
  "My daughter wanted to return to her father\u2019s care and I demanded my partner to leave",
  "He then started sabotaging the hotel by revoking his partnership and letting the bank know that he no longer supported this business",
  "If this was not enough, during the same winter, the roof over the swimming pool collapsed under heavy snow loads, and the bank refused to support the business further",
  "I had to let go of my dream",
  "In the process I had befriended a guest who visited my hotel three times, because he liked to be around me\u2026",
  "",
  "that\u2019s what he said",
  "When he learned about my situation with the hotel, he offered his support and told me that he would stay on my side",
  "Since he was a Chef, and I had talent in the hospitality business, we tried to salvage from the hotel what we could and took over a restaurant in another part of Germany",
  "Herbert, my friend, was married and he claimed that he and his wife plan to separate",
  "They had an adopted daughter and because of her I tried to help him reconciling his relationship with his wife",
  "She had no interest, as she had found someone else, and so the couple divorced",
  "It still took another six months after his divorce was final before Herbert and I became an item",
  "Everything seemed to be working out and I started slowly to trust in my life again",
  "He worked in the kitchen, and I managed the rest of the business",
  "I was on my feet 15 to 18 hours every day and after a few months; it started to take its toll on my health",
  "I never totally healed from my accident and had still an 18\u201d nail in my thigh",
  "Herbert got up at noon and went to bed at midnight",
  "He worked about 8 hours each day in the kitchen and spent the remaining time at the bar of the restaurant",
  "One day I went unexpectedly into the kitchen and found him drinking",
  "He then admitted to me that a little alcohol helped him to be with me and do his job",

  " She\u2019s an exceptional mother, the very best cheerleader a girl or woman could hope for in life",
  " Over the last year, I also learned more about myself through her as \u2013 together \u2013 we helped her overcome significant medical challenges",
  "My mom has a rare blood cancer and has been on chemo for quite some time",
  " One of the manifestations of her cancer is blood clots, including lots of clots in her lungs, so she\u2019s also on blood thinners to manage the clotting",
  " Last November, she had a small internal surgical procedure and was off blood thinners for a couple days to help the wound site heal\u2026but not long enough",
  " In early December she was hospitalized in critical condition, as the wound ulcerated and she was bleeding profusely",
  " She experienced a severe lower GI hemorrhage and hemorrhagic shock, requiring urgent medical attention and 7 units of blood; doctors later estimated she lost about half the blood in her body in a very short period of time",
  " As soon as I could, I booked a flight to be with her",
  " My weakened mother then had a series of medical complications (a long list, including a UTI \u201csuperbug,\u201d pneumonia, kidney issues, low oxygen, anemia, edema, etc",
  ") that necessitated her staying in the hospital for over 3 weeks",
  " I spent 10 days with her at the hospital, 16-18 hours a day (including Christmas), including every night to make sure she had every need covered",
  " With no medical background, I didn\u2019t know how to help\u2026but I learned quickly",
  " I let the nurses know when she needed urgent help, brought meals and encouraged her to eat, ensured she was comfortable, shared family stories, carried out her Christmas requests, liaised with family to let them know updates on her condition, and coordinated visits with close relatives",
  " I also learned that knowledge is power: using her medical app that showed all the results of daily blood draws and other tests, I was equipped with the data to understand and direct our daily conversations with the doctor",
  " I am fairly certain that if my siblings and I hadn&#8217;t been there and intervened as patient advocates with respect to her treatment and care, she would not still be with us \u2013 an empowering but also very scary and sobering thought",
  " In the end, she survived the 3 weeks in the hospital and 6 weeks in a nursing home, and came home shortly before that nursing home had its first case of COVID-19",
  " Nine months since her release from the hospital, she has regained a lot of strength, and spends time working on a book about her parents and helping her grandchildren with distance learning",
  " She\u2019s the strongest woman I know, and I am so fortunate and grateful to have gained some of that strength as well",

  " They would scream at me, yell at me and I couldn&#8217;t take it",
  " The rest of the year people would plot against me and I&#8217;ll be all alone because my best friend chose them over me because she was seeking the validation of other people",
  " And she got it",
  " Then in grade 5, we ended up in different classes so we eventually stopped hanging out",
  " I played with grade 4s coz no one wanted to hang out with me",

  " Ever since her childhood, she had been taught \u201cNever say NO to anyone\u201d even though your heart is pulling you back to not listen to the people, you necessarily have to say \u201cYes\u201d",
  " She had already spent crucial 19 years of her life living with this erroneous belief system formulated by society",
  "One day I met her inside our college premises, she appeared a little confused and hesitant",
  " On asking the reason behind her dubious state, her answer was \u201d Sushmita, I really don\u2019t want to say Yes to P\u201d (it was actually her roommate to whom she had to say \u201cNO\u201dfor certain reason, I am sure I will be dead for revealing this secret after years, but I know, with time we all have become considerably matured enough to understand each other)After listening to her confused voice, I was extremely surprised and asked her \u201cwhat is the difficulty in saying a \u201cno\u201d when your heart abstained from doing the thing that is against your wish",
  "\u201d Her reply was -\u201csince my childhood, my parents and relatives have always taught me to say YES no matter what, everyone expected me to be a people pleaser, keeping my desires aside I had no liberty to say NO to anyone, this is something which has programmed in my mind which when runs, the output will always be a YES, but now as I have grown-up, I am facing the challenge while saying YES to people and I have no clue on how to develop a habit of saying NO, which may hurt the sentiments of others\u201d",
  "After a rigorous session of counselling and practice, she finally learnt to say \u201cNo\u201d with full confidence and audacity",
  "Years after now, whenever we talk about this change of habit in her and correcting her belief system which she had been blindly following for years, we realise how crucial it is to raise a child with the teaching and lessons quoting examples to make her/him understand that saying \u201cNo\u201d is not wrong",
  " And saying \u201cyes\u201d only when your heart is allowing",
  "Today on her birthday, it\u2019s again a reminder for her to invariably remain confident with the habit of saying \u201cNO\u201d ",
  " But I know this has already ingrained in her blood, and this is the reason that she is happily prospering in her life, by saying \u201cNo\u201d to the offers that were trying to put her in a \u201c9 a:m-5 p:m\u201d work routine and saying \u201cYes\u201d to her heart which asked her to become her own boss and begin to nurture her dreams of becoming an entrepreneur",
  "In the end, I would urge all those who cannot gather the courage to say No, \u201cit\u2019s okay to say No perhaps the world will dislike you for this habit, but trust me your soul will be contented and the respect for your &#8220;SELF&#8221; will surely quadruple\u201d~Photo credit: Images courtesy of the storyteller",

  " It was very discouraging",
  " And yes, even though my family/teachers loved my art, I didn\u2019t because the damage was already done",
  " In my teen years, my art started to get a little better",

  " I remember actually following all the directions of the art assignment and receiving an A",
  " Guess what I did with it",
  " I threw it away or gave it to somebody else",
  " Why",
  " Because, that art did not represent who I was",
  " To me, It was just another assignment with extra research that needed to be completed",

  " In the present day, I continue to inspire many kids, teens and even adults, to never give up on learning about art and try new styles",
  " The amount of sass and disrespect that I would get is just irritating",
  " I would provide them with books, tutorials and even give them the many tips that I learned in Digital Arts and Design for free",

  " I will never forget when I fell in love with  a woman and I wanted to make a professional looking picture for her",
  " Guess what",
  " She took it the wrong way and never spoke to me again",

  " My Mother/Father/family members became concerned for my mental health/physical health because, I wasn\u2019t myself with the daycare kids, my mood swings were somewhat extreme, I would starve myself by skipping meals, I ended up becoming my worst enemy and my passion for art/digital art was slowly fading away",
  " There were these two assignments in the traditional art sense that I had to do over many times",
  " On top of my already busy schedule with work/other classes, I was beyond stressed to the point where, I had to see an eye doctor to fix my lazy eye/seek mental therapy ASAP",
  " The story ends with me graduating as one of her top students, but the mental anguish and pain, was enough for me to just pack up my art and to never look at it again",

  " He is a college professor/doctor who has a masters in art or what not",

  " But he does it in a way where he is humble towards many famous artists and looks at the rest of us like we are uneducated swine or lazy people just looking for an easier way out",
  " He mentally tortured me with his assignments",
  " Art analyzation is supposed to be a thing of beauty and grace",
  " I may be alone in this, but he has put the final nail in the coffin when it comes to anything pertaining to art",
  " This professor/doctor took all the fun out of it with his long/drawn out lectures,  that did not help me in the slightest",
  " His way of teaching was so off-putting/unhelpful that I had to do my own formal research, (in an introductory class) look up tips on how to analyze art, watch 3-4 tutorial videos on what to look for when analyzing art, skim/read through a fundamentals art book on analyzation and spend 30+ hours trying to complete all of his assignments in 3 days",
  " Why 3 days you ask",
  " Because I was a full time student and I just did not have the time to balance out his \u201cboring and uninspiring\u201d assignments versus the other two history courses that I am taking",
  " Want to know what else happened between me and Teacher 4",
  " It is quite disappointing to say the least",
  " After going over his syllabus and introductory email/expectations for the class, I dare had the nerve to ask \u201cin a professional matter\u201d some questions about what I can and can\u2019t do in the assignments",
  " He responded back to me in such an arrogant way of stating, \u201cI should know this already, it has been explained and the assignments are super easy",
  "\u201d Well guess what Teacher 4",
  " The assignments were not easy",
  " They were very stressful, caused me migraines, forced me to skip meals/ interrupt my exercise routine for a bit, do extra research/look for an optional college textbook, because you provided me with a textbook that did not fully help me at all with my assignments",
  " Not to mention that your critiques on my assignments were just unnecessary/ nitpicky",
  " Teacher 4 caused me to seek extra mental therapy, caused me to relapse in hating my art again/my perceptions of it and to almost become extremely apathetic towards any critiques/tips that I receive about my art in general",
  " He is a prime example of what an art teacher should not do",
  " Even though Teacher 3 was a mixed bag/very professional during her lectures, at least she didn\u2019t cause me to fully hate art in general",
  " In his mind, the assignments are very trivial and can be done in no time",
  " However, I was very shocked at how a professor who was so nice to me in the email/rooted for me to read ahead/learn more about art, is not being super critical of everything I and the students do",
  " Despite all of that, I thank these teachers for encouraging/discouraging critiques in a verbal/non-verbal way throughout my life",
  " (While one may argue that doing extra research is part of college, I want to remind you all that this is an introduction to art class, where we learn about the history of art and are expected to analyze art without even knowing how to professionally do such a thing",
  " None of his lectures in the online course goes into detail about how to analyze art at all",
  ") So with all that being said, some of you may think that I am overthinking this and that I shouldn\u2019t believe the words that were spoken to me",
  " But what you all fail to understand, is that the purpose of me sharing my experience, is to encourage you all to learn how to properly analyze art and to attempt a new art style every week or month now",
  " Don\u2019t wait",
  " Yes I have been wrongfully treated in my art classes, but it just caused me to become more hungry/thirsty for knowledge",
  " The more critiques I received, the more I wanted so I can do better in life",
  " That is just how I operate as a human being",
  " So what did I learn from all of this",
  " Practice every day in whatever you want to do",
  " People of higher levels will sometimes refuse to help you, because they are either jealous of you, burnt out or just lost that passion/fire that drives them every single day",
  " Do not be afraid (artists of old and new) to try/learn new art styles",
  " Art shouldn\u2019t be perfect and it should represent you",
  " Yes, you should practice until you get it right when it comes to analyzing art and drawing, sewing and etc",
  ", but at the end of the day, people are going to be invested in \u201cyour\u201d art style and \u201cyour\u201d open mindlessness of  how you see art/many subjects of life",
  " We don\u2019t want regurgitated knowledge",
  "  We need want knowledge that is combined with everything that you have acquired through your pain, struggle/endurance",
  " My drive for art may have been burnt out after 21 years, but let yours be an endless light that will never stop emitting radiance",
  " Eventhough I am seeking therapy about this to combat my inner demons/past mistakes that haunt me, I promise to continue to encourage others to pursue art and learn how to analyze in a professional way for fun",
  " These art teachers have taught me what to do and not to do when you are in a position of a leader in a classroom",
  " My hunger/thirst for knowledge in all aspects of life continue to grow regardless of my pain, struggle and the mental illness of an SPCD/GAD that I have to fight every single day",
  " So the next time an art teacher/professor wants to strut their stuff about their knowledge/understanding of art and art history, squeeze every bit of information out of them and do extra research like I did",
  " For some of you, this a career that you want to pursue further",
  " As for me, I am ready to put my art tools away for a bit and go towards another field",
  " Art is supposed to be fun and represent the first amendment",
  " We are all guilty of overly critiquing somebodies art of many age groups, to the point where we inadvertently destroyed/crushed their dreams/drive to do better in that field",

  " Your art style is beautiful, unique and we need more and more different art styles from every single person around the world",

  " I would make a million of excuses for him in my head when it was happening, just like the teachers did",
  " I just wanted someone to reassure me or help me but I was too scared to just scream out for help",
  " I was in denial and just in shock",
  " There would be teachers and students everywhere and no adult came to help me, just a few friends saw but we were so young that they didn&#8217;t know how they could help, it wasn&#8217;t there responsibility anyway, when teachers were constantly made aware of the issue",
  " As where the abuse happened was in such a busy environment with so much noise and full of people, it happened in the school canteen while queuing to get some food and he would stand behind me so close to me while invading my personal space and touch me",
  " I thought the teachers saw it and didn&#8217;t think anything of what was happening",
  " Maybe it&#8217;s just all in my head I used to think",
  " But one friend that saw what happened made me feel like I wasn&#8217;t exaggerating like what was happening was wrong",

  " When speaking to her I would tell her how uncomfortable I felt when he would touch me under and over the clothes, at first I was too embarrassed to say what else he would do but he use his fingers and hand to hurt me",
  " This would be over my clothes and he would be behind me, other times he would touch me under my clothes I would feel so unclean and unsafe",
  " I would make physical signals that I didn&#8217;t feel okay with this such as trying to move from him or placing my bag over my bum as this is where he could not touch me but he would always find a way",
  " Sometimes I&#8217;d leave the line like to the back of the line as thinking he won&#8217;t come now, but he would always find me and come behind me and continue where he left off",
  "I thought I\u2019d ask my teacher as she will know what to do, and I went with a friend but at first I&#8217;d get responses of there&#8217;s not a lot I can do without a name or a firm description, other times there wouldn&#8217;t even be eye contact I felt like she didn&#8217;t care",
  " I tried to explain what would happen but at the same time I was scared if he would get in to trouble or that somehow it was my fault, I just didn&#8217;t want it to get worse and that he could hurt me even more",
  " It eventually stopped because one of my friends saw it happening and got my teacher for her to see it and if she simply asked me in front of him what happened and I said very quietly he just keeps touching me and she spoke to him only a few steps away from me and I could only see that it was a few second conversation",
  " She never spoke to me again or told my parents about it",
  " It did stop after that but I felt so empty, so dirty and so used",

  " I was a child that was crying out for help and someone to just tell me that he&#8217;s going to get consequences and that it wasn&#8217;t my fault",
  " But I got nothing",
  " I changed in so many ways, I started to hate going to school just the thought of a \u202aMonday morning\u202c made me sick, my grades got worse and I just stopped caring",
  " I became angry which was out of the ordinary; I was never the type of child to just become angry like that I would cry or shout at any little thing",
  " I didn&#8217;t trust any adult only a few friends knew at time",
  " Even after the touching stopped I was still followed inside the school I felt so trapped",
  " But I stopped going upstairs where it happened for a while",
  " A while later when I did go always with a friend to make me feel safer but when a male would be behind me the anxiety would be too much so I&#8217;d leave",
  " Even at 6th form I still felt panicked and would only go up with a trusted friend",
  "One time when he was in 6th form he taught my class, I was forced to sit down and look at him and just hear what he had to say",
  " This molester could potentially go on to teach other young girls like myself, isn\u2019t that a scary thought",
  " I started to hate that lesson after",
  " It changed how I viewed things, like myself and other people I saw the world as a dangerous place and that everyone wanted to hurt me",
  " I felt so ashamed, so I didn&#8217;t go into much detail of what he would do to my friends",
  " During this time id get bullied at school about my appearance, and was already a victim of emotional abuse by a family member",
  " I stopped looking after myself I just felt like an object that nobody cared about about",
  " At home I wasn&#8217;t that talkative, happy child anymore I became isolated and just stayed in my bedroom and only come out if it was needed, and my parents were concerned but I was just silent for years because I thought I didn&#8217;t matter, and somehow had blocked some of the memories and thought that I was exaggerating as it was only touching nothing more, but now I see that it was still wrong",
  " When i would be at school I tried my best to fake my emotions by making everyone laugh because i didn&#8217;t want to lose my friends, but when i was alone all that anger and sadness came back and I couldn&#8217;t fake it",
  " Many things have happened after that good and bad I am trying to move on and getting professional help as I felt it was time to talk about it all",
  " I have support of friends and family, and I did reach out in 6th form and speak about what happened and did get support, but unfortunately there was nothing they do because my year 8 teacher did not report it or put it in the system so I have no evidence of what had been said, which I had a feeling about but it still broke me",

  "  It&#8217;s okay to cry, to show your emotions, but its never okay and right to let the society and the people around you pull you down",

  " a few months later again, we were on the road trip to Florida",
  " we had family in Florida",
  " I sat in the back with the trouble maker of a step brother",
  " and again there were blankets in the back and my brother covers my lap and his lap",

  " It was a day before the New Year\u2019s Eve",
  " It was raining so hard",
  " We were playing by that time with my mom",
  " My father went outside to run some errands my mother asked him to do",
  " It was a happy moment turned into sadness",
  " My mom went to the kitchen to fill the pitcher with some water when suddenly she dropped it on the ground",
  " We were bothered by the noise outside so we went out",
  " I couldn\u2019t exactly put it into words but I know one thing, my eldest sister shouted out loud and cried",
  " My mom was lying on the floor",
  " She had a stroke",
  " Still, I couldn\u2019t understand everything",
  " My sister was telling me to ask some help to my uncle which was our neighbor",
  " I ran so fast despite the strong rain and wind",
  " I went there and told them what my sister told me",
  " Still, I didn\u2019t know what\u2019s happening",
  "When I returned back to our house, my Uncle was shaking my mom off, calling for her name and trying his best to make my mom to be okay",
  " I was crying by that time because my older siblings also did",
  " Few minutes later, my father arrived",
  " He was panting so hard, he cried, and one thing I heard from him, \u201cIn Jesus Name",
  "\u201d He was repeatedly saying it and when he couldn\u2019t help it, he decided to bring my mom to the hospital",
  " But before she was brought to the hospital, my mom kept on refusing my dad about bringing here there",
  " I think she\u2019s tired already",
  " I think she wants to rest",
  "When they brought my mom to the hospital, I was left in my Uncle\u2019s house",

  " According to my Uncle and dad, my mom wasn\u2019t accommodated in the hospital right away because there were no doctors on duty by that time",
  " My siblings were crying, my dad and Uncle was so angry because my mom was dying but no one was there to help",
  " It was when my mom was nearly dying that the doctor arrived",
  " I don\u2019t know what happened after that but it was so painful for me when they were telling me the story",
  "The next morning, it was still dawn when I heard my Auntie and her mom talking about my mom",
  " I thought everything was okay because they told me that my mom was doing fine and was in the hospital",
  " My uncle arrived, maybe that was 6 o\u2019clock in the morning when he told me to get ready and bring some clothes for my mom because she needed it for her stay in the hospital",
  "After almost an hour of travelling, I was shocked when my Uncle stopped in the funeral homes",
  " I saw my father sitting there, with red puffed eyes",
  " I saw everyone there, they were hugging me",
  " I was puzzled why they were there, why they brought me there because I thought my mom was in the hospital",
  " Minutes later, my father led the way to my mom",
  " She was lying there, covered with white cloth",
  " The personnel of the funeral homes opened it, and I ran out to my mom immediately",
  " I was crying, shouting and was trying to wake her up",

  " Her biggest dream was to become a stunning actress",
  " She was a multitasker child she knew how to swim, dance, and sing at the same time",
  " Her motive was to be a great dancer, but life takes a turn",
  " When she used to sing, the whole tree starts moving, her voice was so magical to hear",
  " The story of childhood started with ambition, she was so flexible and graceful dancer since childhood, she wanted to be a heard in life with a lot of curiosity and was so naughty wherever she gets the stage, her feet started moving automatically, she has great charisma, people told her parents that she is unique, she started dancing at the age 4, she was knowing what she wants to become in future with an innocent smile and shiny eyes",
  " Her role model was Bollywood actress whom she admires a lot",
  "After childhood when she entered her teens, she started feeling stressed, depressed, and thought maybe this world is not for her",
  " \u201cThe tragedy of life is not death but what we let die inside of us while we live\u201d",
  " Every day, she would cry in front of trees sitting in her balcony",
  " She wanted to become an actress but her parents wanted her to fight on studies",
  " Her parents started scolding her and when she was in class 8th, her whole world changed her, she suffered from bullying, depression and her own parents started hating her because she was weak in studies or she wanted something less, she also left her dance classes",
  " Each day she used to come home from school, each day this was her routine and she was becoming rude, angry and sad, the world and people around her killed her dreams, her hopes and her inspiration to be a dancer, she got new friends but her friend&#8217;s life was better than her, they had everything good family, bright future but she was lacking one thing in her life was \u201cunconditional love\u201d from someone, no one was there to love her, her teachers always made fun of her, her classmates bullied her as she becomes fat and silent, no one talked to her, her teacher even told her in 12th standard that \u201cyou are a useless person, the world would sell you like a thing",
  "\u201d When she raised her voice, she was beaten by her father, or her mother would scold her and compare her with other children from a society that she is fat-skinny, brainless, and should learn something from them",
  " Her parents are a very good person, her mother is a very good mom and she is a teacher and her father works in a factory as a supervisor, she has a brother who loves her but he was not there for her when she needed him the most",
  " Her father\u2019s focus was on his family and he gave most of the money to them, and they are the greediest people",
  " She asked her father one day that \u201cwhy they don\u2019t we go on a family holiday to most Indian places",
  "\u201d, but her father told her to only to focus on the study as she is a dumb and brainless child which brain is filled with garbage",
  " From her childhood to her teens she never saw other states and cities, she wanted to travel, her family would only take her to her grandparent&#8217;s place where also her own paternal grandmother taunted her and said \u201c she is so fat, why is she wearing track pants or jeans, why not Indian kurta that is fully covered",
  "",
  " One of the worst things she did, she changed her dressing sense and started wearing Indian covered full kurta, for 6 years she never wore any jeans, she felt worthless and started avoiding people, her condition becomes worse when she had fear of crowd and people called Enochlophobia, where a person feels danger in any situation",
  " She was scolded for unknown reasons, even her teacher never took her in most of the dancing programs where she wanted to participate",
  "Yes, she was having the best talent as she knows that maybe her future will not be like this anymore",
  " She wanted to leave this evil world as no one was with her by attempting suicide, even her parents were also not with her",
  " In the last days of her schooling, she was awarded \u2018special rose\u2019, as her class teacher named her the \u2018special children\u2019 in front of the whole school as this rose given to them who are weak in all activities, that day she was broken completely, she wanted to do suicide as they plunked her wings and where every student was hoping for great career and life ahead, she was feeling emptiness and worthless in life",
  " She also thought of becoming a fashion designer because she made the best designs and also beautiful paintings, she was an artist",
  " She was not knowing what to do as she was suffering from depression and shame in her life, still she secured 64% in high school (12th)",
  "  Again, her teacher demoralized her and said that without hard work and dedication she got these marks",
  " She was an emotional child or people made her like this, her friends told her she can never suffer from depression or trauma, but \u201cbehind every great smile, there is pain and a story people hide it from the world",
  "\u201dShe wanted to go for higher studies in big cities, but again her parents forced her to study in a small college from her home only",
  " She only wanted a happy life where everyone can behave with her with due respect and treat her equally",
  " She was fat and overweight in her teens she was 60kg, but she loved to dance, this was the best talent where no one can defeat her",
  " But who can break her now, as she was already dealing with a lot of dramas in her life but she was a courageous person who never gave up, she decided to study hard this time, and she was getting good marks, everything was becoming normal in her life, she started speaking more and she also awarded with a prize for her participation in a Group Discussion, in her life she faced her fear and spoke for the first time, from there she started getting praises and applauds for her performance, but your \u201c Past always haunts you because your present is incomplete\u201d, that is what happened with her, her director told her that this time the best student award should be given to the deserved student like her, for that she worked hard and participated in every marathon of her life, but on the day of annual program when the best student trophy was awarded to the topper of the class who was so arrogant, jealous and disrespect seniors were given the award and again her hopes her desires were killed, at time of farewell she hoped that maybe she will get award but again that was given to someone, she was not attracted to awards or trophy but people gave her false hopes and desire, and after sometime, they show mercy on her and gave her the award of \u201cperfect student\u201d, but she was happy but was feeling dissatisfied that after working hard she deserve it, but it\u2019s okay for her, she also found many things like she organized a dance on \u201cwomen empowerment\u201d, from planning to organizing the dance performance  she found a great leaderships quality in herself and she started believing in herself, had faith in god and fought with her parents to send her to city for further study and she did it and still she follow her passion for dance but still \u2018she has a long way to go to prove herself her worth\u2019, she thinks",
  " She also lost 5 kg and gained a lot of confidence and the best thing is now her mother supports her",
  " From there she is starting her journey to become a great HR and motivational speaker in life and to help children who are like her special and also to help people who suffer from depression but she still hopes to fulfill her first dream and wants to travel\u2026if possible",
  " She is hoping that her past will never come back as she buried her past and let it go all",
  " Now she is just becoming the best version of herself and is not afraid of anyone now",
  "At last, I would say that \u201cif you truly want something from the heart, the whole universe conspires to bring it to you",

  "I have been painting my clothes for several years now",
  " It started with painting shoes, than T-shirts, and dresses",
  " My needs for authenticity, contribution, being seen, and self-expression are all met when I paint and when I wear my art",
  " It also inspires others to do the same, and I\u2019m always excited to share the process and tools",
  "Last year, when I got engaged, I wasn\u2019t sure exactly what my wedding dress would look like, but I was sure I wanted to paint it",
  " When friends asked about my wedding dress, I shared my intention",
  " I received some support and some criticism about it",
  " Both relevant but it didn\u2019t matter",
  " The decision had been made",
  " It was hard to find a dress that I would be willing to paint, until a dear friend recommended a local shop in Brooklyn that makes custom dresses",
  " I chose the high/low shape I wanted, and the dress was ready about five weeks before the wedding",
  "The original plan was to decorate the dress with little gold and silver flowers",
  " My then fianc\u00e9 bought per my request, gold and silver fabric ink, and he added green and orange (his favorite colors) to the mix",
  " Right away I told him I wasn\u2019t going to use orange\u2026When the days approached for me to paint the dress (I had a weekend to do so before I was flying to be with him), self-doubt and negative self-talk crippled my creativity",
  " Some of the thoughts included: Why did you tell people you were going to paint the dress",
  " The dress is beautiful as it is, just wear it white",
  " You are no Monet, what were you thinking",
  " I was feeding myself with judgment of how people would react to my painting, and with my own judgment",
  " I\u2019m after all just a hobby painter, and I\u2019m fully aware of my limited capabilities",
  " It was a challenge not to let the inner critic win",
  "I spent all Saturday playing with the sample fabric I got from the shop owner, changing my vision and sketches several times, while trying to manage the voices within",
  " It became clear that the silver painting and the original vision would not work",
  " On Sunday I changed the whole plan",
  " I was no longer going to paint the front of the dress or use silver",
  " I decided to use more colors and paint two flowers, even though the pieces of fabric I had were done, and there was no test left to do",
  "I was inspired by sunflowers, and the fact that when the sun is behind clouds, they turn to each other",
  " I attempted to paint two flowers facing each other (with the inner critic right there wishing I had learned how to paint to give a 3D effect)",
  " I connected their heart shaped leaves, to show our connection and love for each other",
  " I also painted two butterflies, which have unique and special meaning for each of us",
  " Then, my hand got paint on it, and it touched the dress",
  " I had an extra unplanned dot in between the two flowers",
  " The way I fixed it was by painting a bunch of dots, forming a line and connecting both flowers, as to demonstrate that they had each other\u2019s backs",
  " In the end, I did use orange, green and blue",
  "During the reception in Brazil, those who didn\u2019t know my plan, mentioned that they heard a rumor that I painted the dress, and they appreciated my effort and complimented me on what I had done",
  "Since the wedding was in my hometown, people back home I had shared my intention with, are only now seeing pictures of the dress",
  " Many express their disappointment: \u201cI thought you were going to paint the whole dress\u2026\u201d I\u2019ve heard this comment several times",
  " Although it was never my intention to do so, I understand their point of view",
  " Nobody has said that I\u2019m not talented, a horrible painter, or  \u201cwhat were you thinking",
  "\u201d though",
  "The whole process got me thinking about how the desire to be accepted, loved, seen a certain way, may have the ability to cut our wings, and keep us \u201csafe\u201d in a place of compliance, contraction, and avoidance, rather than living in a place of authenticity, openness and self-reliance",
  "I have no regrets (well perhaps the dress, which seemed fine on the hanger but not so much in the wedding pictures \u201cshould\u201d have been pressed but I digress), and I\u2019m delighted by the outcome",
  "Lessons learned when overcome by the voices within:Inner critic \u2013 The inner critic may sometimes also be influenced by perhaps not even too real expectations of how others would perceive us",
  " If we learn to let go of how we want to be perceived, life can be lighter",
  "Accountability matters \u2013 Once I shared with whoever asked about the dress that I was going to paint it, I felt accountable to doing so",
  " Although, it was ultimately up to me to change my mind, and I ended up adding perhaps unnecessary pressure to myself, having shared my plans gave me the extra strength to move through the inner critic and do it anyway",
  "Self-acceptance is key \u2013 From the beginning, I knew that a mistake could happen, and I told myself and a friend, that if I made a mistake, it would be incorporated in the painting, because that\u2019s real life",
  "Flexibility and Trust in Self \u2013 Once I realized the original vision I had considered for weeks, wouldn\u2019t work, I trusted my ability to simply paint, and gave myself permission to adapt, change and come up with a more doable plan on the spot",
  "Authenticity \u2013 I never imagined myself wearing a mermaid or princess dress, they aren\u2019t me",
  " Therefore, my authenticity showed up through my painting, regardless of how others may experience it, this is me",
  "How about you",
  " How are you showing up authentically in the world",

  "Dedication: To all Child marriage survivor's&#8220;My name is Bhagyashree Saini and more than anything, my primary identity is that &#8220;I am a child marriage survivor\u201d",
  " I fought for 11 years to come out of this social evil and iam proud of it",
  "Remembering my Khetri daysI was born and brought up in the rural  setup of Khetri Nagar, a small town in the Jhunjhunu district of Rajasthan, and I am highly thankful to my parents for raising me up",
  " This is because the birth of a girl child in my area is considered, more of a curse or a bane",
  " I studied upto fifth standard in an english medium school and then switched to a hindi medium one,   afterwards",
  " There, I skipped many classes in order to complete my school education as early as possible",
  " Life for me, was very normal",
  " But it was just like a brief silence before the storm, an event that would change my life forever",
  "The storm arises &#8211; My Child marriageThe month of April 2006  brought a huge storm in my life, in the form of my child marriage",
  " I will not say that it was forced upon me, but it was definitely against my will, as I was at a very young age to understand and comprehend the upcoming consequences of this mere \u201cone day long event\u201d, and the way the whole society would treat me &#8211; including my parents, relatives, neighbours, my so called pseudo-friends, and all those characters who in future will enter into my life with short-term pre-destined contributions &#8211; positive or negative",
  " The roller coaster ride begins &#8211; The beginning of a 11 year long journeyI immediately raised the red flag as my inner voice rebelled said \u201c No Bhagyashree, you never intended to live like this",
  " You wanted to pursue your dreams and maybe this will act as a roadblock for your bright future\u201d",
  " Though, I was not aware of the legal validity of this event, but for my ambitions that I am meant for something bigger, I went against the will of my family, left that place and went to Jaipur, without having an inch of an idea of what I will do next and how will I survive",
  "I tried my level best to remain attached to my dreams and ambitions",
  " I joined NCC during my graduation, which for the first time in my life, made me realise the capability, energy and discipline inside me to pursue my dreams",
  " Within NCC, I gradually got promoted to the rank of  \u201cSenior under-Officer and won \u201cBest Cadet award\u201d, \u201cBest shooter award\u201d, and \u201cGold medal in anchoring\u201d",
  " This instilled the required passion inside me to pursue my dreams further",
  " I graduated from science and then went on to complete my post-graduation from Public administration",
  "In Jaipur, I took the responsibility of sustaining my life, on my own, and started my career by first working as a counsellor and then as a placement officer",
  "  The biggest irony with this social evil is that, wherever and whenever you will share this illegal tag of \u201cchild marriage\u201d with anyone and the pain you are undergoing due to it, they will start taking you as a \u201crebel girl, who is just running away from her reality, because she wants to live an independent life\u201d",
  " For others, it was an interesting story to discuss",
  " This is the way society functions and thinks, as child marriage in many societies, including our Indian society, is such an accepted norm, though declared illegal by government, that they easily equate it with a legal institution like marriage",
  " Jaipur made me realise that in order to do something better with my life and pursue my dreams in a better manner, I need to be aware of the opportunities available",
  " With this thought, I decided to prepare for civil services and for that I have to shift to Delhi, the capital of our country and the place where opportunities and ambitions converge",
  "My encounters with societyThe preparations for civil services, since 2011, while staying in Delhi, made me realise that the event that occurred with me some years back, is actually an age-old social evil, and it is not only me, rather there are millions of girls out there, not only in India, but even in developed societies like USA, who become a victim of child marriage every year",
  " At the same time, Delhi taught me how society treats a child marriage survivor",
  " I was being judged on the basis of my purity and chastity",
  " This instilled so much fear inside me that I started hiding this event",
  " Whenever, any friend of mine, came to know that I am a child marriage survivor, they suddenly used to stop talking to me, as if they will catch some contagious disease",
  " Majority behaved with me as if I am an outcaste or a slur on the face of women in society",
  " There was a point where even I also started taking this event attached with myself as some mistake committed by me",
  " I became a victim of false promises, taunts, abuses, devaluation, emotional tortures, rejection and all the demeaning treatment you can think of",
  " I still remember one statement of a person towards me that &#8211; \u201cYou should stop praying to God, as nothing good can happen to you, as you are a bad girl &#8211; That\u2019s why bad thing only happen to you like child marriage",
  "\u201dSome would say \u201cyou should be grateful towards us as we are doing a huge charity for you by accepting your child marriage\u201d",
  " I even got to listen some laughable statements like \u201c Come on, your\u2019s marriage was not a child marriage as child marriage is something which can only be accounted for if the girl has not attained the age of puberty",
  "  You are just doing it to gain sympathy from the society\u201d",
  " Gradually, I went into depression because of all this feelings of worthlessness, severe financial constraints, zero support from my family, fear of being rejected etc",
  " But, life had got something else in store for me, something bigger, something better than i expected",
  "The rise of a proud survivorIt is rightly said that \u201c God is always for those who have no one\u201d",
  " The almighty always provides you with a window of light when there is darkness all around",
  " Many life changing events happened",
  " Firstly, I was legally able to get rid of being a child marriage victim in 2017, though an inappropriate word \u201cdivorcee\u201d got attached with my profile",
  " This is the second biggest irony of my life, a loophole in our legal system, where a word used to describe the end of a legal institution of marriage  is also simultaneously used for ending an illegal custom of child marriage",
  " Secondly, I got myself certified from the world renown universities like Harvard, Stanford and British Columbia on Women &amp; Child rights issues",
  " Presently, I am an author and a blogger on many national and international platforms like UNICEF,  International Youth Journal, women web, story mirror, PenThere, youth ki aawaz etc",
  ", writing for the issues concerned with Women and Child rights",
  " I also run my own blog for generating awareness on Child marriage",
  " Very recently, I have been conferred with &#8220;Women achievers award&#8221; on International Women Day, 2020,  by B",
  "N",
  "Patel Institute, Vadodara",
  " Currently, I am serving as the President of Women and Child Wing for National Youth Council of India (NYCI), Rajasthan, and as National Women Secretary for Masoom Bachpan foundation, along with my preparation for Civil services",
  " And most importantly, today I proudly proclaim myself a child marriage survivor",
  "The lessons learned and my future venturesSometimes people accept me sometimes they reject me",
  " Sometimes they think I am a rebel, sometimes they think and try to ensure that I fit according to them",
  " Sometimes I am ambitious which is a dirty word according to them and trust me I am very ok with it because they are not accepting this social evil attached with my personality",
  " But for me  it includes my overall package which I carry",
  " And many times it&#8217;s a filter which removes those people who are not like minded",
  "  Now, I am more clear in myself and I have realised that from where these mentality comes and I completely understand the fact that it&#8217;s not only about  low education, it&#8217;s about those deep rooted and regressive thoughts which they carry with themselves throughout their life",
  " I chose to be ambitious, a women of my own words and I know the cost of it",
  " In this journey, with my heart and soul, I can tell everyone one thing that \u201c It\u2019s very hard for a girl to fight with her own family, society and regressive thoughts\u201d",
  " The biggest paradox I have seen in my journey is that the people who were more educated were the ones who contributed the most towards discriminating a girl",
  "Every child brides around the world should know that no social evil is bigger than your dreams and ambitions",
  " So let yourself remain trapped in it",
  "  Just come out of it, with your full strength and be your own hero",
  " The worst lines which I have hated throughout my journey is that \u201cWe are accepting you",
  " This word in itself is enough to downgrade all your fights, struggles, ambitions and dreams",
  " So pursue your inner voice to be in a position \u201cto accept\u201d, not \u201cbe accepted\u201d",
  " For me, being a child marriage survivor, is a source of strength, an answer to many of my unanswered questions, an introduction to my personality and the real face of the society",
  " Today nothing much have changed inside me except the way I take myself and my journey",
  " I am still working to attain the best version of myself",
  " Today, every other person whom I meet, tell me that only due to child marriage, you are better and different than others, a role model for many, though I don\u2019t like this hero status, as the journey still continues and there are millions of women who need my presence",
  " At last, I want to say to this society \u201cIf you can&#8217;t treat us like heroes, then you don&#8217;t have any right to treat us like victims either, as you can never understand the real cost of my child marriage, which took 11 years of my life&#8221;",

  " My father died when i was only 5yrs (am one of the last borns), so i was left hanging with almost no sense of belonging paternally",
  " i grew up with my mother with the help of her family",
  " so because of that i felt always vulnerable and disadvantaged because of the many people who helped me and i had to please all of those people",
  " i had to stand out hard working in funerals, parties and any other occasion",
  " i always felt or it appeared that it was children like us who had no fathers/ orphans and poor to extend a hand in such occasions ie fetching water, we always gave a hand as other children were seated with their parents enjoying the party",
  " I had to stand out to win my relatives&#8217; love and approval mainly men relatives who i wished they were my father because i lacked a father figure",

  "My Uncle told me that it&#8217;s okay for me not study/achieve, after all, all my siblings had not studied, so nothing is expected of me, He continued that it would surprise everyone if his children don&#8217;t study/excel but me, no, &#8220;so you don&#8217;t have to be hard on your self",

  " By this time, I had entered my Junior year of college",

  "So hey everyone, I usually don&#8217;t share anything over the web",
  " But I wanted to share this story because recently I have seen someone ending their life for this same reason",
  " A bit about myself, I am a 21 years old guy from India who dropped out of college because I wanna do what I love",
  "Anyways I had my enough share of bad experiences myself from racism, nepotism to bullying &amp; death",
  " We were migrants basically, my parents moved here when I was a baby, so yaa we were poor too so basically tough love",
  " From an early age I experienced both nepotism, bullying and racism because I am black and a migrant, and as I am the first child I got some responsibilities from very early age",
  " And at that time I didn&#8217;t knew tough love, I just used to think no one cares about me",
  " But one thing which I thank for is, all that tough love made me really scared of death so ending my life was never an option",
  " Well it surely did made my life a hell but atleast I am not dead",
  " So it went on but at that time I had a very good friend, which we still are",
  " Well we don&#8217;t share anything though but even if one person makes you feel like I am with you at every situation, it&#8217;s was more than enough for me",
  " It was like this till 6th standard I guess, after that I lost someone very close to me, which made me to not believe in god and become atheist",
  " I am still an atheist but now as I think back and I think I did the right time by being atheist because that taught me to believe in myself",
  " Because at that time the only person I believed in was god, but after his death I lost the belief in god, and after that I think I truly changed",
  " I changed my personality totally from being a scared guy I tried to become more confident, when someone use to bully me, I started confronting them even though I was fucking scared inside, I didn&#8217;t let them see that",
  " I started accepting myself, I use to accept that I am black and it&#8217;s not a big deal",
  " But in the early stages it still made me furious and disturbed when someone made fun of me because of my color and ethnicity but I didn&#8217;t let them see that",
  " I use to behave like yaa ok it doesn&#8217;t bothers me and all",
  "Which made me kinda introvert, because I can&#8217;t share my feelings with anyone",
  " Things started changing after that for sure, I wasn&#8217;t bullied anymore, but everything wasn&#8217;t smooth yet",
  " One more thing from a very early age I was into tech,my friend&#8217;s father had a mobile phone, so I used to visit him a lot",
  " His family loved me a lot, so every time I visited him I used keeping messing with his father&#8217;s device, and after that my dad bought a CDMA device in which we can surf internet",
  " I use to surf internet a lot but I didn&#8217;t knew anything about internet packs, I didn&#8217;t even knew how using money you can recharge your phone",
  " Anyways because of that no one shared their device anymore",
  " Anyways back to the timeline, so I wasn&#8217;t bullied anymore I started making friends in my class in my neighborhood",
  " After 8th standard I lived my school life to the fullest, I bunked my classes, got dismissed from school, had some fights with students and teachers",
  " And one more thing I was into studies a lot, I love science",
  " So academics wasn&#8217;t a problem for me after 8th, because of that my parents also stopped worrying about my studies",
  " Everything was great till I was living my school life, but because of all those early experiences and teenage, I wasn&#8217;t truly confident",
  " I use to think that no girl would never say yes to me and I had a lot of crushes during those teenage time",
  " It was the same till 10th, but after 10th results were announced and my father saw I scored really good, he was so proud and admitted me in a very rich school, where only rich kids study",
  " Anyways one thing that I realize now is my parents did everything they could to give me a better life, it&#8217;s just that I couldn&#8217;t understand that at time, and now as I grown up and I see through there perspective, they did everything right for me",
  " They weren&#8217;t the problem at that time, I was a mess, my parents were busy earning enough to never let me experience poverty and all the bad experiences they had",
  " And specially my mom, even though she use to beat me and all, she made me what I am today",
  " She taught me to be strong to never show your weakness to anyone, how to hide your feelings and just focus on the goal, and things like success is the best revenge, she really taught me how to be independent and to be confident",
  " And I can never thank her enough for that",
  " Now back to the story timeline, I am in 11th standard now in a rich kids school, well I had a great experience in that school",
  " I learned a lot, apart from studies I experienced a lot when you&#8217;re the only one in the school who talks in hindi, just because he isn&#8217;t that confident to talk in english in front of others, and stuff like when your parents aren&#8217;t rich as there parents are",
  " Anyways it wasn&#8217;t a big deal for me, because I just use to ignore this stuff and when my teachers use to ask me something and expected me to answer in english, I was always like okay I am out of the class, there was a time when I use to leave my botany classes by myself, when my teacher entered the classroom",
  " High school was a very different experience for me because at that time I learned a lot about the real world and money",
  " Because I was in a rich kids school, I learned there lifestyle, their way of thinking, about societies, about making money and all those adult stuff",
  " I was just 14 at that time, so that was so new for me",
  " I never thought of money like this, and my parents never let me experienced or taught anything about money",
  " Anyways that was my teenage years, so I did what most of the high school teen does, drugs, bunking classes, rebellion personality",
  " Also I loved tech but my parents wanted me to be a doctor, which also created a lot of tension in the family",
  " A lot of things happened at that time, but in the end I can say that after all those experiences, I was a guy who had his future planned to be a software engineer, because I already knew how to code",
  " I was confident and life was good",
  "After my 12th my next big experience happened, at 16 I had my first relationship",
  " Everything was great in that relationship my parents were supportive her family was supportive until a year later she broke up on a phone call without giving me any reason",
  " That was very dark time for me, because the worst part was I can&#8217;t share this with anyone, and my mom kept asking me about her",
  " That breakup taught me a lot, I learned to really being independent, and her dad made me realize that how important money is if you wanna get the girl you love",

  " I wasn&#8217;t close to him at all but it just that when I heard his story about why he killed himself, it made me realize that these kinda thoughts use to haunt me too and how difficult it was but there are some person who doesn&#8217;t have privileges like a very good friend, a great family",

  " Two hours might seem short, but it\u2019s the complete opposite when you\u2019re constantly getting picked on by your teachers",
  " Fun fact: I actually counted how many times I\u2019ve gotten picked on in every class for a month before I decided I couldn\u2019t take it anymore, and the numbers turned out to be around 20-30 times",
  "Now you might be wondering why I waited for a whole month instead of just quitting after that happened",
  " Well I told my friends about me thinking of quitting for good, but they said that I was an excellent dancer so I should stay until I couldn\u2019t take it anymore",
  "During that month, I even had my mom come in with me to try to talk with my teachers, but when they saw me, they immediately stammered \u201cOh, sorry, I\u2019ll be late\u201d and walked away",
  "Another reason why I quit ballet was because of self-consciousness",
  " In the studio, there\u2019s a huge mirror, so we can correct ourselves if our form isn\u2019t right, but constantly staring at myself and then at others made me compare how I only have a curve on one side of my body",
  " Also, all the dance moves felt different all of a sudden because the side with the curve has less muscle, so I couldn&#8217;t hold my leg up as high as the others and as high as the teachers wanted us to",
  " I was on one of the highest levels of ballet at my studio; therefore, the expectations were set pretty high",

  " My life ends here",
  " I\u2019d rather die than living with metal in my body",

  "It was time to decide whether I wanted to get surgery or not",
  " My dad agreed because it only takes 8-24 hours to become \u201cnormal\u201d again, my mom didn\u2019t want me to, my brother was in University and was busy, and it was up to me",
  "Fortunately, my mom found an alternative to surgery and that was going to the chiropractic place or however you say it",
  "There is also something I need to tell you about my dad",
  " My dad as you can see doesn\u2019t see the downsides of surgery and how it could affect my entire life, and after that check up, he screamed at me for not taking swim class like my brother and why I had chosen ballet",
  "\u201cI just didn\u2019t know, okay",
  " Besides, I hate when water gets into my ears, but at least I have great friends who taught me how to swim, so if I got thrown into the deep end of a pool, I won\u2019t drown",
  " On the other hand, you have no friends\u201d I told him",
  "Oh my gosh, you won\u2019t believe what he said to me after that",
  "\u201cYou\u2019re such a disgrace to our family",
  " Why can\u2019t you be tall like your brother",
  " Everyone in the family is tall, so you should be too",
  "\u201dThen I lectured him that he shouldn\u2019t be playing favorites, and I screamed some pretty nasty roasts at him such as \u201cOh, remember when you didn\u2019t get a job because of how fat you are",
  "\u201d and \u201cHow are you ever going to lose weight if you keep on saying that you\u2019re buying cookies for me, but you end up eating like 100 cookies a day for every meal",
  "\u201dHe stayed silent, and I did too",
  " I was so thankful that my mom was on my side and told my dad to shut his smelly breath up",
  "\u201cYour breath stinks",
  " Ew",
  " Do you ever brush your teeth",
  " Look how nasty your teeth are",
  " They\u2019re so yellow and you have so many cavities",
  " No wonder why the dentist doesn\u2019t like you,\u201d said my mom, acting like those popular girls in school",
  "My mom and I were laughing so hard while my dad just stayed quiet because he realized that he was outnumbered",
  "Oh, I almost forgot",
  " One time when I got just one wrong on a test, my dad saw and his face showed that he was about to kill me",
  " I was literally about to call the police at that point, but decided not to because he\u2019s my dad",
  " When I confronted him about all the terrible things he has done to me, he apologized, but I knew better",
  " Actions speak louder than words, and he didn\u2019t stop his inequality talk between my brother and I",
  "Anyway, my dad reluctantly agreed to the chiropractor thing, though it was only my mom who brought me there since I think my dad has had enough of me",
  " It took awhile for me to get used to how they move my body, but the amount of improvement was fascinating to watch",
  " They also gave me a list of certain things I\u2019m forbidden to do such as twisting my neck and spine because my neck is attached to my spine so they somehow affect each other, and bad posture",
  " If I do them, my life would still be in danger as I don\u2019t go there every day, and those would cause more damage to my heart and lungs",
  " Sometimes my mom would be too busy to take me there, so it would only be my dad, but that\u2019s a problem because every time I go there, I see improvement in my spine",
  " Then, every time I have to do a quick check up, they always ask if I have grown taller or if I\u2019ve seen any improvements, but even though the real answer is yes, my dad always says no",
  " To me, that\u2019s a significant sign that he wants me to get surgery so I could be \u201chappy\u201d and see faster results",
  "I also have school, and for school you need a backpack, right",
  " Well regular ones crush my spine, so another option would be to use a rolling backpack",
  " Now I didn\u2019t want to, especially in middle school with crowded halls; I had no choice",
  " When I went to school with my new rolling backpack, I was careful not to trip anyone, though it just sometimes happens",

  " Just frickin go already\u201d or \u201cBruh why do you have a rolling backpack in middle school",
  " So annoying\u2026\u201d I didn\u2019t say anything, but my response in my head was \u201cDo you know how hard it is to go through a tight space with a rolling backpack plus uneven hips, shoulders, ribs, a crushed heart, a severely curved spine, ugh everything",

  "\u201d Oh why can\u2019t everyone just accept the fact that I have a rolling backpack",

  " All the stress that I\u2019ve been through such as the doctor check ups, ballet, school, family, and unthoughtful friends really got on my nerves, which gradually transformed me into a maniac from an innocent school kid",

  "I am an extremely extrovert, optimistic, people person and for me a regular day wouldn\u2019t end without meeting with at least 50 people",
  " It was around 5 years from the time when I quarantined my art, and that was to crack AIEEE",
  " But I couldn\u2019t withstand the staying without it",
  " And the next time I came, I came as a dancer who never wants to leave the stage",
  " Since a regular time, I always ensured to not stay at home even in the weekend",
  " I ensured to rush, run and engage myself with lots and lots of people around the city",
  " I never want a day to be spend with out art",
  " Somedays it was dance or drag or performance art",
  " My body became accompanied with a constant Adeline rush to create, create and create art",
  "But, Soon the news of corona virus creeped into my devices, I tried to convince myself",
  " It won\u2019t come to my country, or my city and as it developed, I ensure, I can still get a place",
  " I can still get people and I still share my art with personal effect",
  " However, as the time passed the boundaries around me sucked in and became tight",
  " Post the lock down announcement, I got confined to be into four walls",
  " The first week was majorly went retrospecting and telling myself, I cannot stop",
  " Thankfully I had a camera and a friend who can click pictures",
  " It was then I decided I would create an art with this medium",
  "I started performing drag in 2019, June",
  " Drag, an artform usually a man who performs as a woman but now evolved from Dress Resembling a Girl to Dress resembling a gender",
  " For drag I used to shop a lot, pick up clothes I loved, items I liked",
  " I used to create looks and then shop and spend a bomb to make that look",
  " Drag gave me a way of expression",
  " Drag also helps me to create voice for myself",
  " While quarantined,  I started telling myself \u201cQueer people lived half of their life in closets, so it would be a cake walk for us to  be isolated for few days but it actually gives opportunity to put the heteronormative society within a confined space so it could get slighter of the closet experiences",
  "\u201d And that is why its important to be in drag when in quarantine",
  " Every day I picked up a look",
  " The first week as I started, I got the very inspiration from the excessively heard term over the week \u201cCorona Virus\u201d",
  "While the pandemic was already threatening the country, it was important to call it \u201cOrdinary\u201d to ensure we don\u2019t create panic but create awareness",
  " Culture of anti-art gives the opportunity prevailed to represent even diseases",
  " Taking an example from Japan, when in the 1960s and 1970s where Hijikis Tatsumi was dancing in the Butoh, after the end of the postwar reconstruction of the Second World War, was entering a high economic growth period",
  " Meanwhile, the manufacturing industry in Japan abandoned all the waste to the river, and the sea on the coast of Japan was contaminated with garbage, heavy metals such as mercury and cadmium that caused mutations in human cells, causing a number of pollution diseases",
  "In the past, Minamata in Kumamoto prefecture was affected by mercury sulfide dripped from the fertilizer company Nippon Nitrogen, the spine of the fish curls and cannot be sold on the market, the local fisherman ate it without knowing were contaminated with mercury pollution",
  " And, many people were victims of serious Minamata disease",
  " Tatsumi Hijikata, who continued to collect the weakened bodies, incorporated it into his own dance with the deepest resonance in distorted limbs of Minamata disease patients",
  "While the modern dance people were enjoying the creation of a beautiful dance, Tsutsumi Hijikata alone has resonated deeply in the shape of its deformed and disabled human life and had created a novel Beauty that has never been in human history",
  " This was the idea to decentralize drag to representation of disease in human form",
  " When you present something in a human form there is an awareness, a reliability and an imagination which makes people be aware",
  " Just as how Liberty , Nation&#8217;s , Elements if life are represented in multiple art forms, it was also essential to represent a disease to untag the fear and make it just a person to fight with",
  "As the days followed, I was running out of my ideas of cloths and fashion",
  " it was then when I started picking up trash or lump material which I already had and started using it time and again to create an image of what art needs to look like",
  " As I went on, I created an drag Art specimen called \u201cHairy Fairy\u201d",
  " When it comes to body hair, society\u2019s standards for beauty for women are certainly stricter than they are for men \u2013 many people expect them to be cleanly shaven and even the slightest hint of hair is seen as \u2018gross\u2019 and \u2018unsexy\u2019",
  " This series of photography was to challenge the idea of beauty and natural hair",
  " Showing it to extreme view point on what if the body had so much of hair",
  " I used some of my wigs to create this S",
  "A",
  "S (my drag name which stands for Suffocated Art Specimen) named &#8220;Hairy Fairy&#8221; through which i wanted to pass the message of being bold and embracing the body and its every part of it",
  "This madness of converting trash started so high that I started looking for things around me",
  " Due to  the lockdown a friend of mine couldn\u2019t procure cigarettes as cigarettes being considered not an essentials item",
  " All he could do is to curb himself and I making talking this opportunity to motivate him to leave them",
  " As a result, he gave me all his previous cigarette packets which he stored in a box",
  " I Created a look from 50 empty cigarette boxes procured from him",
  " the look titled \u201cSmoking God\u201d is more than just a look",
  " It\u2019s a performance art sitting and making it while passing the inhibition to choking oneself with smoke",
  " This calls out a wave to end the choking game",
  "  a campaign to ensure there is no more smoke lighting up",
  "As the days passed my madness of creating drag grew more and more where I wasTrying to work on placing certain object in certain space to create a certain outlook",
  " Calling them the avant-garde (from French, &#8220;advance guard&#8221; or &#8220;vanguard&#8221;, literally &#8220;fore guard&#8221;) which are works that are experimental or innovative, particularly with respect to fashion, art, lifestyle or culture",
  " The avant-garde pushes the boundaries of what is accepted as the norm or the status quo",
  " I worked on another look with all the waste silk cloths I had collected for a while called \u201cRotten Silk\u201d where I wanted to create a bright image with things available to me",
  " The #Tranimalization of fashion and color need to be scrubbed into a disformed structure and that\u2019s how the rotten silk was born",
  "The blue and the pink denotes the color of expressions and symbolizes the trans flag, blue being masculine and pink being feminine and out of which emerges a disformed figure which gender delusions",
  " The too muchness presents the spectrum of gender and the visual eyes shows up a mirror to the society to self-reflection",
  "Creating these images for myself made me realize how much time, Money and affordability was the experience going and buying my drag materials from outside",
  " I still remember the stares the society shoots when a boy steps into a Women\u2019s wear shop or a cosmetic shop and asks for Kajal",
  " Quarantine has taught me to be free within the walls loving myself daily",
  " It taught me that how we abuse privilege for art and how can we get inclusive and bring the essence of art in everything around",
  "  This quarantine helped me develop the ideologies to relook Drag art and create a new version of the art form some thing  which is a  function of subversion is to reveal the absurd, the intermediary between the day-to-day and the intrinsic ideology creating it, which then opens up that ideology to responses of judgement, mockery, quiescence or anything that satisfies the immediate, visceral shock",
  " Drag serves as the subversion of gender, revealing the ideology of capitalism, though more often and less correctly identified as detached patriarchal structures",
  "As the time and self retrospective has been developing within , i thought of creating a virtual space for drag",
  "Keeping all the socio-economic changes in mind, I wanted to create a space exclusively for drag",
  " A space where we can get news, interviews, articles, memes, quotes and information on the Indian approach to drag",
  " This idea gave birth to my baby \u2018Drag Vanti\u2019 \u2014  an online space for desi drag queens, kings and performers",
  " It also serves as a channel to give information about the cultural and ethnic drag art form practices within India and how the version of Indian drag is different from what the world perceives as drag",
  "I created this open space with the idea to bring drag culture to mainstream in India and help provide equal attention to drag as all the other art forms",
  " Drag Vanti is a website wherein young and aspiring drag performers can find all the information they need to harness their art",
  " Drag Vanti has been created with a vision to have more conversations on the art of drag and create a community while sharing stories and newsletters",
  "They would also be able to create a profile that\u2019d serve as a portfolio for their work",
  " Drag Vanti contains a dictionary of all the drag slang and terminologies used, along with an additional vocabulary of Indian drag terms",
  " The online platform also has a directory of all drag performers, artists, makeup artists, drag clubs and spaces to enable opportunities for collaboration, curation, partnership and representation within the community",
  "I am happy that Drag Vanti serves as India\u2019s First Exclusive Drag website with an online quarterly e-magazine by the same name, launched by and for drag performers",
  "As a famous poet said \u201cKeep an artist in a dark room for few days and ask them to draw and that is what becomes a master piece\u201d similarly the more days I start sitting and internalizing as a part of quarantine, it creates a likely madness to new art which is refreshing as well as inspiring",
  " I may not be fighting directly with the pandemic, but my art gives me a veto power to keep myself motivated and sometimes mass social messages through drag",

  " only very little I felt I got a help because they were helpless in getting me an ESA which I only thought to be a solution initially&#8230; but still one day I questioned myself how will an ESA help me and I have got the answer in my mind that the ESA would be only helpful and will be a real ESA when I would have a pet who understands me",
  "",
  " and then I have another question of how will the pet understand me ",
  " I have an answer to this is that it is only possible if I would be successful in understanding my pet first&#8230; and then I got curious about how the animals communicate ",
  "",
  "The incident of loneliness and interest and love in animals made me think to pursue animal behaviour in the future and to do a good research in how animals communicate and to find ways to make human-animal communication possible",
  "",
  " so I suddenly got interested in pursuing animal behaviour course and I tried to search for the colleges that offer this course ",
  "",
  " I end up getting some colleges successfully but I had trouble in understanding about the registration, admission and as those colleges were forieng Universities which are out of my family&#8217;s budget so also about Visas, financial aids , educational loans and scholarships&#8230; I have the problem in understanding about the overall admission procedures and the ways to make it possible to really study there&#8230; it was so difficult that although I tried a lot and I end up even taking the help from the college people itself about these things for only three universities Indiana University Bloomington, Eckerd college and University of sterling",
  "",
  " so I understood the application process a bit more but still I found understanding about the admission procedures so frustrating that I ended up thinking I won&#8217;t able to get into any of the colleges I have found&#8230; but I got at this stage after a lot of hard work &#8230; and after I tried to take help from my sister ( although she wasn&#8217;t talking to me but started talking to me a bit ",
  "",
  " so I asked her for the help ) and the cousin sister who&#8217;s my sister&#8217;s suggestion to take the help because the cousin sister is settled abroad so she knows more than her&#8230; but taking the help wasn&#8217;t that useful although the cousin sister was nice towards me even when I talked to her after the years but she was still very busy to actually able to answer all of my queries",
  "",
  " I tried talking to my sister again for this problem then she told me I won&#8217;t able to do it because I am finding the required processes for getting the admission boring&#8230; I told her that I got frustrated in understanding about that because I wanted to start studying animal behaviour earlier ",
  "",
  " I told her that because I felt like the colleges only need a good score in English proficiency entrance exams and a profile which shows a lot of knowledge about animal behaviour",
  "",
  " so I felt like for pursuing even the admission in animal behaviour course I will get to study about the animal behaviour for the majority of my time even before an admission to make a profile which is good for animal behaviour",
  "",
  " but unfortunately rather than getting the time for that my time got wasted in figuring about how to get an admission at the universities&#8230;when I told her about that she got mad at me and told me to dream smaller instead&#8230; as I had been asking her a lot of questions inspite her busy schedule by sending long messages on the whatsapp&#8230;It even led to more arguments as I also told her that I am frustrated from the fact that she considers her friend the family and she don&#8217;t consider me and people at home her family&#8230;",
  "and I also told her that I can&#8217;t able to make such close friends like the way she has ",
  "",
  " so my friends don&#8217;t consider me a family",
  "",
  " instead they love their real family members&#8230; and are insecure in trusting the outside world",
  "",
  "She got mad at me and told me that it&#8217;s because I am jealous of everyone because they are capable of loving and I am not at all capable of loving anyone and then she ended the conversation and told me that she won&#8217;t reply to my messages &#8230; she told me all of that when I have also mentioned in the messages that I loved her but still she loves her friend more than me&#8230;I felt very sad after that day",
  "",
  " and I have lost my energy to do more research on higher studies and I ended up making plan B of pursuing online job with my personal research&#8230; but still I haven&#8217;t able to collect the required material even till now because the college exams are comming and I haven&#8217;t done the preparation for that",
  "",
  " so my days were gone in trying to study for that although I failed to study because my mind wasn&#8217;t in that everytime I tried to study&#8230;after that conversation, I even got frustrated on my previous friend about why she loves her family more and can&#8217;t love me like her family",
  "",
  " it made the arguments so worst that I ended up hearing from her that if I would talk about that forcing her to be my family then she won&#8217;t talk to me ever again ",
  "",
  " so I felt like apologizing her even though deep inside I am very frustrated and pissed off from her thinking and her insecurity",
  "",
  " but I tried to show the empathy towards her&#8230;",
  " and even though she is not angry on me anymore&#8230;  I am feeling even more lonelier and sad now a days&#8230;",
  " I still wanted her or someone else to say that they love me like a family&#8230; which everyone found wrong to tell me&#8230;not even my real family members dad, grandparents and my sister says that&#8230;so now a days I had been feeling terribly lonely and I am scared from the amount of loneliness I have in my life &#8230;",
  " as I always had been that alone but still never got used to it because somewhere I really loved my sister and mother &#8230; and they left me&#8230;",
  " so I always had trust issues but I still ended up spending a lot of time with my mom and sister ",
  "",
  " so much that now without them it feels kind of weird and scary&#8230; even my mom&#8217;s death didn&#8217;t bothered me so much earlier because I had my sister at that time",
  "",
  " but now a days when my sister left me I miss both my mom and her&#8230;Even though I am trying to move forward by trying to focus on my interest in doing a research on animal communication and animal language",
  "",
  " and I have also found a community and an animal behaviourist who&#8217;s goal is same as mine&#8230; about finding the ways to make human animal communication possible",
  "",
  "I am even happy about that I am not alone in my research",
  "",
  " but still deep inside I am still afraid of spending some days alone&#8230;I can only able to come in contact with those people in my life when I would have done some good work in this research&#8230;but I haven&#8217;t done anything",
  "",
  " I have only estimated some possibilities without studying about anything",
  "",
  " it&#8217;s just a normal thinking or belief which I have to make a reality before getting in contact with them&#8230; so it will take a lot of time to proof that in the real life",
  "",
  " so much that it will take years to do some real work in that research",
  "",
  " only after that I would able to meet other like minded people&#8230; moreover it&#8217;s not only that&#8230; my desire to make human animal communication will also open me the opportunities to make animals my family instead of humans and I always found animals better than humans",
  "",
  " so even if I won&#8217;t had any like minded people who wants to make human animal communication possible",
  "",
  " I am still very devoted on finding the solutions to make human animal communication possible&#8230;it&#8217;s because I love animals very much and I believe in getting the love from the animals by working hard",
  "",
  " but I still don&#8217;t believe in getting the love from humans by working hard because of all the things I have experienced in my life",
  "",
  "inspite the fact that this research also includes studying about the human behaviour in detail as for human animal communication we need to know about the behaviour of both animals and humans in detail&#8230; even though this research could make me more capable of understanding other humans also in some way &#8230; but still I would never able to trust the people like the way I trust animals&#8230; but inspite my own choice of not trusting the people&#8230; I will always feel a void of having a human&#8217;s love in my life&#8230;",
  "In fact even though this idea of finding the solutions to make human animal communication possible have stopped me from commiting a suicide",

  " but still indirectly sometimes I think that I also want to involve in the research because I won&#8217;t able to notice how my years will go in that and I would easily able to spend my whole life to get the time of my death naturally&#8230; this makes me think that I am commiting a suicide indirectly by getting involved in a life time research&#8230;I still think that I would have to spend my life so it will end soon&#8230; so somewhere my desire to die is still there with me&#8230;",
  "I would only able to feel happy in reality when I able to have a family like bond with someone whether that&#8217;s an animal or a person",
  "",
  "before that I would never be happy for real &#8230;",
  " even if I would spend my life in doing a research",

  " and I would still get scared of being lonely for real&#8230; it&#8217;s just like a mental disorder&#8230;but I would able to consult a doctor very late in my life only when I would be financially independent&#8230; as my family members don&#8217;t care about showing me to a psychatrist and even though I tried to tell them a lot about it&#8217;s importance but still they never listened to me and always told me that I am fine&#8230; even if I am not fine at all&#8230;it&#8217;s just a sad reality of my life that I don&#8217;t have anyone who loves me&#8230; I hope one day I will get ride of this lack of love even if it means my death after spending my life in doing a research&#8230;I just want my loneliness to end either by my death or by getting someone either an animal or a human in my life to love me like a family&#8230; both of these things would satisfy me&#8230; I am craving and trying my best for the latter but I am not sure about whether that will happen in my life ever or not",

  " I just needed to lay down",

  " He noticed they haven\u2019t scanned my upper abdomen but his decision was not to refer me back as he assumed it was IBS",
  " He put me on tablets for IBS believing it\u2019d sort the pain",
  " Unfortunately, I was getting worse so I kept going back to my GP and they kept doping me with different types of tablets for IBS",
  " None of them worked so I eventually gave up",
  " There I was again, going through my highs and lows,I was stuck in the same circle of good days and bad days knowing there was no point for me going back to my GP as I wasn\u2019t getting anywhere",
  "Almost two years after giving birth some of my symptoms were gone but there was always something new coming up",
  " My hands were getting numb",
  " It went on for a few months and just because some of my symptoms went away gradually in the past, I thought I\u2019d wait and live on instead of going back to my GP",

  " My hands were getting so numb I started dropping things, it was waking me at night, I had trouble cutting veg while cooking",

  " My hands were so numb I struggled to hold umbrella in my hands so I felt lost and useless",
  " I wasn\u2019t giving up though",
  " When the letter came I had my appointment two weeks later",
  " The specialist examined me and referred me to Edinburgh for some nerv test",
  " The doctor wasn\u2019t convinced it was carpal tunnel syndrome as at the time, I experienced numbness in my feet as well so they referred me to Neurology stating that if they won\u2019t find anything they\u2019ll send me for surgery to relieve numbness in my hands",
  " A month later I drove more than three hours to Edinburgh for a nerve test",
  " It was inconclusive",
  " It took more than eight months to get to neurology",
  " But those months were months of pain, tears and many sleepless nights",
  " My stomach bothered me more than it ever bothered me before, i was getting so nauseous that I could not walk up the stairs at times, I spent hours and hours on the living room floor not being able to get up because I felt so sick",

  " Whatever I put down my stomach it kept coming up, even when I drank water",

  " I felt so old despite of my very young age",
  "  It literally felt like my body was falling apart",
  " Due my stomach problems I had to go back to my GP a good few times to get help",
  " I felt so embarrassed paying these visits but I didn\u2019t want to live like this",
  " Eventually, my GP decided to refer me to Gastroentologist",
  " The day came when I saw gastroenterologist",
  " For the first time after seeing all these doctors, nurses and other specialists the tear literally ran down my cheek as I felt so lost",
  " The lady listened to me so she thought she\u2019d refer me for more tests but they returned normal and told me to come back in two months time",
  " So I did and I wish I never",
  " It was a different gastroenterologist I saw",
  " As soon as I entered the room I felt something was not right",
  " Instead of asking me about my issues, the man was more interested in my name, where I\u2019m coming from and it all felt so confusing",
  " Eventually he let me speak but he did not listen",
  " What he said was \u201c I could run some tests but I\u2019m not going to because I don\u2019t think there\u2019s something wrong with you but I want you to come back in one month time\u201d Around that time I was seeing neurologist and he did listen to me",
  " He examined me and referred me for MRIs to see if the problem is in my spine or neck",
  " He insisted I had to go back to gastroenterologist so I had no choice but to go back adding it\u2019d be either something too simple or something too complicated",
  "A month later I was back at the clinic seeing the same gastroenterologist as I saw the last time I was there",
  " He sat me down and said things like, \u201c what a shame we met in such circumstances but unfortunately , I am not going to run any tests on you as there is nothing wrong with you\u201d he told me he believed I needed to see a psychiatrist and psychologist as the problem was supposedly there",
  " He suggested to ask my neurologist for happy tablets as they were able to prescribe them",
  " I was in shock so It was very hard to fight back",
  " I felt like I was going to break down and cry",
  " And I did",
  " The tears came out and all he said was that he was going to see me in one month time",
  " I instantly knew I wasn\u2019t gonna be back",
  " As soon as I left the hospital I got in the car, drove to nearest parking lot in Dumfries and as soon as the engine stopped, I broke down in tears",
  " I cried and cried and cried",
  " I never felt so low in my life",
  " I\u2019ve never chosen any of this",
  " Deep down I knew it was not in my mind even if he tried to convince me otherwise",
  " I stood there at the car, I gradually calmed down and drove myself over fifty miles back home",
  " A few weeks later I was back at the clinic seeing neurologist",
  " After reading letters from gastroenterologist he labelled me with Functional disorder and advised me to see a psychiatrist or a psychologist and offered me antidepressants",
  " I was told not to go and see any doctors but he still asked me if I could go and see a rheumatologist so that they can repeat the same tests again just to make sure",
  " I could sense from him that he knew this was not in my head but logically he played his part and did all he could",
  " My body was taking over my life and they were telling me the problem was in my head",
  " I wouldn\u2019t have thought that someone would try and make me question my sanity over my body",
  "All letters from specialists were sent to my GP so I went to see them",
  " I never read any of the letters that gastroenterologist sent at the time,  but he pretty much convinced everyone that I was crazy, hypochondriac, anorexic etc",
  " It was pretty obvious I could not fight back and somehow, I started to question my own sanity so I agreed to be referred to a psychologist",
  " I was put on antidepressants which I\u2019ve been taking for months and months",
  " Things didn\u2019t improve",
  " I was getting worse",
  " I ended up at the rheumatology clinic like I was asked to do so and they said pretty much the same thing as everyone else \u201c I advice you to see a psychologist\u201dDuring those months I have accepted myself that it was all in my head and try to live on",
  " There was still not a word from Psychology at this point",
  "However, some time in mid summer of 2018, four years after giving birth, my stomach problems did not get better and the pain on the right side which had continuously worsen since it began was giving me bad nights sweats and waking me at night",
  "The time came when I changed my GP and saw someone completely new",
  " My records were not transferred at the time I saw my new GP at the new clinic so they had to go with what I had to say to them",
  " That day I was so lucky as he was the only doctor who made his own opinion because they listened to what I had to say",
  " As soon  as I told him my story he made it clear that I could do with going back to endocrinology and they referred me for an ultrasound of my upper abdomen that was cancelled back in 2016",
  "The ultrasound clearly showed my gallblader was causing me so much trouble so I was referred to General surgery",
  " My referral was urgent so I had my letter pretty much straight away",
  " The specialist I saw that day went through my records, read through letters from gastroenterologist and other specialists and made it clear with me and stated I need to go and see a psychologist despite of the fact the results showed the problem was not in my head but in my gallblader",
  " I was devastated and my new GP could not understand what was going on but one thing was crystal clear,  I had to prove it was not in my head",
  " I was on the long list to see a psychologist through NHS so I decided to go private",
  " I found an experienced psychologist which was based in Ayr so it didn\u2019t take long for me to see them",
  " My appointment lasted around an hour  and the lady came to one and only conclusion",
  "I was not the one who needed a psychologist",
  " She never took any money and told me to go back to my GP",
  " There I was, back in my new GP\u2019s office",
  " My new doctor did not hesitate and referred me for a second opinion so that I can get tests done in order to get the right treatment",
  " Around that time, January 2019, my throat was getting very painful",
  " Just like I have mentioned above, I had problems with my throat but doctors believed it was just a cold",
  " This time it was different and the pain was more intense",
  " I struggled to swallow and it didn\u2019t let me sleep So I had to go back to doctors",
  " I was told to take paracetamol and then come back if it wasn\u2019t getting better",
  " Unfortunately, it turned worse so they put me on antibiotics but they didn\u2019t help either so I was referred to throat and neck clinic I\u2019m Dumfries",
  " At the same time, my body felt like it was shutting down, I slept during the day and felt like I had no energy at all so while I was still sat in the doctors office one thing went through my mind and that was my thyroid as somehow doctors stopped paying attention to it long ago",
  "I asked my doctor to check on it and so they did",
  " As soon as I had my results I was put me on the lowest dose of thyroxine",
  " February came and so has my appointment with ENT clinic",
  " I remember myself standing outside the new hospital in Dumfries, scared, anxious as I really didn\u2019t want to go in In case I was told again it was all in my head but somehow, something told me to go",
  " The nurse called me in to see the specialist",
  " I told her about my issues with my throat as well as my stomach  and I admitted my throat was a lot better than it was in the past two months prior to my appointment",
  " While I was there, the doctor put camera up my nose",
  " It was uncomfortable but the result shocked me",
  " The doctor went back on her chair and said \u201c you need to see a gastroenterologist\u201d I instantly had a ball in my throat and said no",
  " She obviously wondered why I was so reluctant so I told her my story and she was pretty shocked even though the bigger shock came a minute later",
  " The nurse at the ENT clinic used to be a nurse for the same gastroenterologist I was seeing back in 2017",
  " I was reassured not to be afraid as the man that caused so much trouble was being  let go by NHS as there were too many complaints",
  " We all stood there looking at each other and I was left speechless",
  " The tear ran down my cheek but this time from this some sort of relief",
  " The doctor advised me on vitamins to take for my thyroid which I am grateful for to this day and reassured me there will be no more trouble when I go back to gastroenterology clinic",
  "around this time, my antidepressants were stopped and I finally felt like I was getting somewhere",
  " In between my appointments I finally I had a good few sessions with psychologist through NHS and they eventually discharged me, admitting there was nothing to treat",
  "Prior to my appointment with gastroenterologist I was back at general surgery seeing a consultant",
  " He came up with a couple of tests that could have done but the MRI department refused it as they didn\u2019t think it was necessary which he stated in the letter sent to my home",
  " He came up with the idea of doing two ultrasounds",
  " One ultrasound would be done on an empty stomach and one after I had something to eatSome time in May of 2019, the day came and I was standing outside Dumfires hospital again to see gastroenterologist",
  " At this point, it was obvious I was not crazy but after what I have been through, I was scared as I didn\u2019t want to go through the same thing again",
  "Once I was called in, the doctor asked about my symptoms",
  " They told me that after putting camera in my nose at ENT clinic  discovered I had a lot of acid in my stomach as well as in my esophagus which caused my sore throat during those years",
  " They put me on tablets and I soon felt a lot better",
  " As months went on, the doctor soon increased the dose of Levothyroxine to 50mg a day which I have been taking diligently with tablets I had prescribed from gastroenterologist",
  " Slowly but surely, I felt better",
  " I felt like the old me",
  " My stomach problems were gone as well as other symptoms",
  " Around this time I had an appointment for my ultrasounds and I kind of hesitated as I finally felt great",
  " The last thing I wanted was to waste any more of my time running about hospitals again",
  " Despite of me being reluctant, my new doctor advised me to go so I attended my appointment back in September 2019",
  " It was a surgeon who did the ultrasound as he knew what to look for but I was being very sincere with him and told him I feel no pain anymore",
  " Whether you believe it or not, it was a very strange thing for me to say after all I\u2019ve been through, I finally felt okay",
  "but",
  "",
  " not for longMy energy level was slowly going down and my body went completely crazy again",
  " My hair was falling out badly, I was tired, gaining weight and even when I went to gym I felt so weak and dizzy I could not do a thing so I went for a blood test to check my thyroid level again",
  " The doctor that checked on my results made a decision to increase the dose of thyroxine to 75mg a day",
  " In spite of that, I felt like my body was taking over my life again",
  " No matter how hard I tried  I could not carry on",
  " My gut was telling me there was something not right so I decided to see my new doctor",
  " After he looked at my latest results he was pretty much shocked I was only on 75mg of Levothyroxine so he gradually increased it every four weeks to get my thyroid level stable",
  " I\u2019ve been on 125mg  since then",
  "In the past 6 years I traveled all around Scotland to see many doctors, specialists, consultants, and nurses",
  " I underwent many unnecessary tests",
  " I was given tablets I was not meant to take in the first place",
  "I was being labelled with many psychological disorders and shut down by doctors",

  " \u201cAnd happy birthday\u201d",
  " she told me giving me an extra squeeze",
  "\u201cWhen can I open my presents\u201d",
  " I asked with excitement",
  "\u201cNot until after you\u2019ve blown out your candles\u201d",
  "\u201cOr now\u201d, I teased her",
  "\u201cNice try, but not until later\u201d, she said laughing",
  "Like a violent storm suddenly unleashing itself on a bright day, my stepfather yelled for me to come to him",
  " He sounded angry",
  " I looked at my mom, my heart sinking as she nodded for me to go see what he wanted",
  " I stood in the doorway and waited for him to say something",
  "\u201cCome here\u201d, he demanded",
  " I slowly crept closer, watching his face as I neared him",
  " He never took his eyes off mine",
  " I came to a stop in front of him, my heart beating quickly as I held my breath and waited",
  "\u201cYou think you\u2019re special\u201d",
  " he demanded",
  " His eyes bore into mine as he waited for a response",
  " My brain scrambled for an answer",
  " I looked down at him as he continued to lie on the couch",
  " His face was slack, but his eyes hardened with contempt",
  " I remember thinking I was something important in the small world of mine, maybe not special, but something good",
  " Just before I could latch onto that thought, he blew it away",
  "\u201cYou\u2019re nothing\u201d, he told me \u201cdefinitely not special, not even important\u201d",
  " He sat up and studied me for a second, like a vicious bear getting ready to deliver a final blow to his prey",
  " I remember feeling the sting of tears welling into my eyes",
  " \u201dYou\u2019re just a little speck of dirt\u201d",
  " There it was, his final blow",
  " My lips trembled as tears ran down my face",
  "\u201cGo get a bowl of hot soapy water and wash my motorcycle\u201d, he said",
  " He sat back against the couch and lit a cigarette",
  " He seemed pleased with himself now, satisfied with his kill",
  " \u201cAnd while you\u2019re cleaning it\u201d, he continued \u201cI want you to remind yourself how worthless you are",
  " You ain\u2019t something special just because it\u2019s your birthday\u201d",
  "I ran to the kitchen and looked for my mom, but she was gone",
  " I began to cry harder as I filled a bowl with water",
  " I carried it into the living room and headed towards the front door with my eyes cast down",
  "\u201cYou better do a good job, or you won\u2019t be opening your precious presents later\u201d, he called after me as the screen door closed",
  "As I stepped off the porch, I heard the sound of kids yelling on the corner",
  " They were playing kick the can",
  " The sun was bright behind them as they ran around trying to head each other off",
  " The sound of the can hitting the pavement was followed by shrieks of laughter",
  " I watched them for a moment, jealous of their lives, angry with mine",
  " As I washed my step father\u2019s motorcycle, I began to feel ashamed for thinking I was a good person",
  " I began to feel like I deserved to be treated badly",
  " He\u2019s right I thought to myself, I\u2019m worthless",
  " Guilt overwhelmed me for thinking otherwise",
  "Life\u2019s Little LessonsWhen you tell a child they\u2019re not special they believe it, especially when it\u2019s a parent",
  " It stayed with me all my life",
  " Once guilt set in I began to think I was guilty for everything that happened to me",
  " I tried to be as unnoticeable as possible",
  " If no one could see me, no one could hurt me",
  " A behavior I carried with me for many years",
  "I did attend church when I was a little girl",
  " I loved Sunday school",
  " I always felt safe there",
  " I learned the words to Jesus Loves the Little Children, and read stories about His kindness and love",
  " I remembered looking at the picture books of Jesus surrounded by little children, some sitting on his lap",
  " How I wished I were one of those children",
  " I knew He would never hurt me",
  "When I was around fourteen my mother and stepfather divorced",
  " I remember him packing up his things to leave",
  " I was tempted to go in there and help him",
  " I was worried he would change his mind and decide not to leave",
  " Once when I had overheard him say we wouldn\u2019t be able to make it without him, I piped up and said we\u2019d all pitch in and be fine without him",
  " I had spoken without thinking and thought he would be angry, but he just laughed",
  " He didn\u2019t think I was serious",
  " But he did end up leaving",
  " There were no tearful farewells, just a welcome sense of finality",
  "My mom didn\u2019t know about the abuse",
  " No one talked about things like that then",
  " And children rarely tell",
  " They live in fear of what may happen to them if they do",
  "My mom was a hard working woman",
  " She put food on the table for five kids, we never went without anything",
  " When she wasn\u2019t working she was always home with us",
  " I\u2019m sure we drove her crazy",
  " Four girls and one boy, and one bathroom",
  " There was a lot of drama with four girls",
  " Someone was always yelling at someone about something",
  " All the neighborhood kids hung out at our house, but my mom never complained",
  " One neighbor thought my mom was running a halfway home for wayward kids",
  " My sister Kim, who escaped the abuse, was bursting with confidence",
  " She took me under her wing",
  " When we were little she always did things for me she thought I wasn\u2019t capable of",
  " Whenever we were getting ready to go somewhere, I always stood back and let Kim open the car door for me",
  " That was our ritual",
  " Then one day my mom said \u201cRobin, you can open the door for yourself\u201d",
  " So I did from then on, but I missed my sister opening it for me",
  "Even though my stepfather was gone, he had left me emotionally fragile",
  " I had no confidence in myself, no sense of self-worth",
  " I was broken",
  " I had a difficult time making friends of my own",
  " I didn\u2019t think people liked me and I was surprised when they did",
  " I expected the worse in people and the worse in myself",
  " I was quiet and withdrawn",
  " My mom once said I was a somber child",
  " I thought she said sober",
  " So when people asked me why I hardly ever smiled, I told them I was sober",
  " I always wondered why they looked at me so strangely",
  "Relationships with men were always a problem",
  " My stepfather had demeaned me for so many years that I believed that was normal",
  " That\u2019s what I was comfortable with",
  " I seemed drawn to men who were abusive",
  " After years of this I somehow managed to meet a good man",
  " I was always marriage shy, but I decided to finally take the leap",
  " That was monumental for me",
  " Trusting someone unconditionally with my heart",
  "I know now that was unrealistic, husbands and wives are going to let each other down, say things that are painful and do things that hurt one another",
  " But I had put so much faith in my marriage that when it began to fall apart it was more than I could handle",
  " I didn\u2019t have a strong emotional foundation to endure it",
  "On top of all the pain of a failing marriage, people I thought I could always trust betrayed me",
  " Then my son began distancing himself from me and he wouldn\u2019t allow me to see my beautiful granddaughter anymore",
  " She and I had always been very close",
  " She stayed with my husband and I so much she called me mom",
  " I always had to remind her I was grandma",
  " I had always had a good loving relationship with my son too, so I had a very difficult time dealing with what he was doing",
  "I remember when he was around three I was reading him a bedtime story, and he fell asleep snuggled up next to me",
  " His little cheek was pressed against mine",
  " That was such a perfect moment",
  " I told God I could spend eternity with him in my arms like this",
  " He always knew without a doubt how much I loved him",
  " I couldn\u2019t understand why he was doing this to me",
  " I felt like he didn\u2019t love me anymore",
  " I couldn\u2019t cope with that",
  " My children were everything to me, they were my world",
  " I began to feel like I was a terrible person, that there was something wrong with me",
  " Otherwise why were the people I loved so much hurting me so badly",
  " Just like I did when I was a child, I rationalized I deserved it, that I was unworthy of love",
  "Months of this went by, and I found myself feeling more insecure and sadder",
  " Nothing was getting any better",
  " My job performance became affected, marital problems left me emotionally drained",
  " I missed my son, I missed my granddaughter",
  " The hurt from what he was doing was tearing me apart",
  " I carried that with me every minute of everyday",
  "My feeling of depression grew until it became overwhelming, it was incessant",
  " I felt like crying all the time",
  " I had no desire to get out of bed or eat",
  " When I did get out of bed I stayed in my pajamas all day",
  " I had no interest in anything anymore",
  " I didn\u2019t know where to turn, I began to shut down",
  "Depression is a relentless cycle",
  " The more I thought about what was happening, the worse my depression got",
  " The worse my depression got, the more I would think about things",
  " There\u2019s no escape",
  " People would say \u201cjust stop thinking about things\u201d",
  " Really",
  "",
  " Thanks, why hadn\u2019t I thought of that",
  " You can\u2019t turn depression off like a faucet",
  " The faucet is broke",
  " I wanted so desperately to be myself again",
  " I was willing to try anything",
  " My doctor put me on anti-depressants, but they didn\u2019t seem to work, so he\u2019d try a different kind",
  " Each time I\u2019d think please God let this one work",
  " I literally begged my doctor to help me find a way to end my depression",
  " My mind was in overload",
  " My brain couldn\u2019t find a place to land",
  " So many thoughts were running through my head at one time, so much pain",
  " I began to feel trapped in this dark feeling of loss",
  " Trapped in my own mind",
  " Depression eats away at your brain, at every thought, until there are no thoughts left, just utter despair",
  "The weight of sadness became so real I could actually feel it bearing down on my chest",
  " It was no way to live",
  " Who wants to spend every minute of every day feeling that way",
  " I began praying to God that I would die during the night",
  " I begged Him to let me die in my sleep",
  " But I always woke up",
  " I was so angry for still being alive and having to endure another day",
  " I was scared to be alive, scared of what was happening",
  "After about a month of this I was taken away to a psychiatric center in handcuffs",
  " I\u2019ll never forget the traumatic events of that day",
  "\u201cThere are people outside waiting to talk to you Robin\u201d",
  " The woman on the phone told me",
  " \u201cI\u2019ll stay on the phone with you until you go outside, just do what they tell you\u201d",
  "\u201cWhat are you talking about\u201d",
  " I asked",
  "\u201cJust go to the door and open it\u201d",
  " This time her voice took on an authoritative tone",
  " I got up off the couch and looked through the peep hole",
  " A uniformed police officer was standing off to the side of the front stoop",
  " He was peering around a tall hedge, his hand resting lightly on his gun",
  " I quickly backed away from the door in shock, stumbling on my housecoat",
  "\u201cWhat did you do\u201d",
  " I cried into the phone",
  " \u201cWhy did you call the police\u201d",
  "\u201cThey\u2019re going to help you Robin",
  " Open the door\u201d",
  "\u201cNo, no\u201d",
  " I cried, \u201cwhy\u201d",
  " I felt like I was suffocating as I gulped for breath",
  " Tears covered my face and fell like rain onto my chest",
  " I tried wiping the tears away so I could see, but they were falling so fast it was of no use",
  " I stumbled down the hallway trying desperately to brush the tears away, I reached my daughter\u2019s room and crouched near a side window",
  " I slowly peeked over the window sill",
  " Another police officer was standing just outside the window, but he didn\u2019t see me",
  " He was looking toward the front of the house",
  " He too had his hand resting on his gun",
  "\u201cRobin\u201d, the woman said",
  " \u201cWhat are you doing now\u201d",
  "I was gasping for breath, afraid to move, scared I would be shot",
  " \u201cWhy\u201d",
  "I whispered to her",
  " \u201cWhy have you done this to me\u201d",
  "\u201cIt\u2019s for your own safety\u201d, she said sounding aggravated",
  " \u201cThey\u2019re not going to leave until you go outside",
  " You don\u2019t have a choice\u201d",
  "\u201cI never said anything about wanting to kill myself\u201d, I whimpered",
  " I slid down to the floor and covered my mouth with my hand, my fingers pressed hard against my face",
  " I didn\u2019t want the police officer outside of the window to hear me sobbing",
  " I couldn\u2019t grasp what was happening to me",
  " I hated this woman on the phone, this woman who had no idea who I was",
  " She didn\u2019t know anything about me",
  " Yet she reached into my life with her jagged pretense and ripped a hole in it",
  " I was shaking frantically, my hand barely able to hold onto the phone",
  " I could hear the woman on the phone saying something but I wasn\u2019t listening",
  " I looked around my daughter\u2019s room as I crouched on the floor",
  " Just hours before I had came into her room, kissing her cheek softly as I woke her up for school",
  " She had put on cotton candy scented balm before she had went to bed the night before, I could still smell it as I had bent down to kiss her",
  " But now pressed against the wall of her room I felt like an intruder wreaking havoc into the lives of the family who lived there",
  " What would they think of me huddled against the wall while policemen waited outside to take me away",
  "\u201cOkay\u201d, I told the woman on the phone",
  " \u201cI\u2019ll go outside",
  " My daughter Mariah will be home soon and I don\u2019t want her to see any of this\u201d",
  "\u201cGood\u201d, the woman said",
  " The compassion she had feigned earlier was gone now",
  " She seemed anxious to be rid of me",
  " I imagined this would make for interesting conversation when she sat down to dinner tonight, clucking her tongue as she recounted the events, all the while feeling smugly superior that she had saved the day",
  "I opened the door slowly",
  " \u201cPut the phone down\u201d, an officer commanded",
  " I was confused and wasn\u2019t sure where to put it down at",
  " I was still thinking like a human being, but I had lost that distinction when I opened the door",
  " \u201cNow\u201d",
  " he yelled at me",
  " I quickly put the phone down near my feet",
  "\u201cCome down the stairs and stand here\u201d, another officer snapped as he pointed to an area in the yard",
  " I did as I was told and quickly ran down the steps, my bare feet slapping against the concrete",
  " I counted a total of five officers",
  " Two squad cars were parked in front of the house, a third parked on the side",
  "An officer walked behind me and told me he was going to handcuff me",
  "\u201cWhy",
  " What did I do",
  " What\u2019s happening\u201d",
  " I sobbed",
  "\u201cPut your hands behind your back\u201d, he ordered",
  "I had never been handcuffed in my life",
  " The weight of the handcuffs rubbed against my wrists painfully as he tugged at my hands",
  " With a quick jerk they snapped into place",
  " I stood on the front lawn feeling like I was on exhibition, a freak sideshow in a circus",
  " Cars slowed down as they passed the house, some almost coming to a complete stop to get a good look at me",
  " I turned away from the road to avoid their gaze",
  " I felt ashamed, even though I had done nothing to be ashamed of",
  " The curtain from the house next door was discreetly parted, but I could still see the face of my neighbor staring at me through the window",
  "The police officers were standing around talking to one another now",
  " Every so often one of them would laugh and shake their head",
  " They were acting like they were at a neighborhood barbeque casually talking about a football game",
  "\u201cCan one of you put me in a squad car please\u201d",
  " I begged",
  " \u201cI don\u2019t like being left in the yard for everyone to gawk at\u201d",
  " They turned and looked at me, appearing annoyed that I had interrupted their little hen party",
  "\u201cWe\u2019ll put you in when we\u2019re ready to\u201d, an officer spat at me",
  " He looked at the other officers gathered around him and laughed",
  "\u201cWhat have I done\u201d",
  " I cried",
  " I was angry now, angry with the woman on the phone and angry with the police",
  " \u201cIs this because I\u2019m depressed\u201d",
  "Fresh tears rolled down my face",
  " \u201cIs this helping me",
  " Is it\u201d",
  " They looked at me with no empathy, no compassion",
  " I could feel my anger growing as they stood there watching me with amusement",
  " This morning I was a wife and a mother, a so called respectable citizen",
  " Now I was a circus clown in handcuffs",
  "Eventually an officer approached me and steered me to a squad car",
  " \u201cWhere am I going\u201d",
  " I asked him",
  " He didn\u2019t say anything",
  " \u201cCan\u2019t you at least tell me where you\u2019re taking me\u201d",
  " He placed me in the backseat and slammed the door without saying anything",
  "I couldn\u2019t wrap my mind around what was happening",
  " Why am I being treated like I\u2019ve done something wrong, like I\u2019m not worth one scrap of kindness",
  " I hung my head and began crying",
  " The officers were talking to one another now as we drove down the road",
  " One of them laughed and said something about the \u201ccrazy ones\u201d",
  " So that\u2019s it I thought, I\u2019m crazy",
  " That\u2019s what they think",
  " \u201cI\u2019m not crazy\u201d, I stammered through my tears",
  " I sat in stunned silence as we drove through town",
  " My mind was blank now, void of any hope of being rescued from this hell",
  "I saw the hospital looming ahead as we continued to drive",
  " The patrol car slowed down and turned into the entrance marked \u201cEmergency Room\u201d",
  " \u201cWhat are we doing here\u201d",
  " Neither of them responded",
  " \u201cWhy are you ignoring me\u201d",
  " I yelled in frustration",
  " \u201cDon\u2019t I have any rights\u201d",
  " We came to a stop in front of the crowded waiting room",
  " They each took an arm and marched me through the sliding doors",
  " They paraded me through the waiting room like I was an infamous outlaw that had finally been apprehended",
  " All that was missing were the flashing lights of cameras and the urgent voices of reporters asking how they did it",
  " They stared at me in my handcuffs and bathrobe as we made our way to the admissions counter",
  " The admissions clerk looked at the officers as they gave her my information",
  " Now and then she glanced at me, then quickly looked away if I met her gaze",
  " It reminded me of an old joke I had heard before, \u201cdon\u2019t make eye contact with the crazy people\u201d",
  "When they finished admitting me, the officers led me to a room at the back of the emergency room",
  " They finally removed the handcuffs when the security guard arrived, apparently relieving the officers of their claim on me",
  " The security guard stood outside of my room with his hands behind his back",
  " Now and then he glanced at me as if making sure I wasn\u2019t planning to escape",
  " The only furnishings were a hospital bed and a small stool with wheels on it",
  " There were no cabinets in the room, no medical equipment hanging on the walls",
  " This was a room for people like me",
  " A room with nothing I could use to hurt myself or anyone else",
  " It didn\u2019t feel like a safe room, it felt like a holding tank",
  " I sat on the bed and waited, not sure what I was waiting for",
  "\u201cCan I call my family\u201d",
  " I asked the security guard",
  " \u201cI know they\u2019re wondering what happened to me\u201d",
  "He looked at me and said it wasn\u2019t up to him, that I\u2019d have to wait for somebody from the hospital staff to talk to me",
  " I sat there and waited, lost in my thoughts",
  " Finally, someone entered the room with a clipboard in his hand",
  " He sat down on the stool and glanced at his paperwork",
  "\u201cHow are you doing\u2026\u201d he glanced at his paperwork again \u201cRobin\u201d",
  "\u201cHow do you think I\u2019m doing\u201d",
  " I responded angrily",
  " \u201cHow is this supposed to help my depression",
  " If a person wasn\u2019t suicidal before, this would definitely make them consider it",
  " I never told that woman on the phone I was going to kill myself",
  " She wasn\u2019t even the one I wanted to talk to",
  " I was trying to call Gina my social worker at the cancer center\u201d",
  " I didn\u2019t give him time to interrupt me",
  " Maybe he would let me go",
  " \u201cI just wanted to talk",
  " I was having a bad day",
  " But Gina wasn\u2019t there, another woman answered the phone",
  " I told her I\u2019d call back but she was practically begging me to talk to her",
  " She seemed so desperate to talk, I practically felt sorry for her",
  " So I gave in, I told her I had been feeling depressed lately",
  " She started asking me all these questions over and over, I was getting confused\u201d",
  " I started getting angry just thinking about her",
  " \u201cSo she called the police and then I was being hauled off like a criminal\u201d",
  "The man with the clipboard looked at me for a moment",
  " He didn\u2019t seem to care one way or another",

  " One time in particular she refused me my right to make two phone calls a day",
  " The psychiatrist was arrogant and uncaring",

  " I actually tried to hide in a closet from it",
  " If it couldn\u2019t see me, it couldn\u2019t hurt me",
  " Depression was the monster at the door now",
  " I was terrified",
  "My little bit of sadness in the beginning turned into Major Depressive Disorder, also known as Clinical Depression",
  " Clinical Depression is the more severe form of depression",
  " I\u2019d take my pills faithfully",
  " I put a lot of faith in those little pills waiting for them to do big things",
  " But I stayed the same crazy me",
  " That\u2019s what people say when you\u2019re depressed, that you\u2019re crazy",
  " I probably did seem crazy",
  " When you\u2019re depressed you don\u2019t react realistically to difficult situations",
  " I was already on an emotional roller coaster, so I just drug everyone else along with me kicking and screaming",
  "I felt like I had been dropped into someone else\u2019s miserable life",
  " There were so many voids in my life now, and nothing to replace the emptiness that was left",
  " There was no semblance of my old life, nothing for me to drop anchor on",
  "Eventually I began to see a therapist, a mandatory therapist",
  " I had no choice other than to go, or I\u2019d be taken to a unit",
  " There was no way I was going back to the Stephen\u2019s Unit",
  " My therapist once asked me why I felt like giving up",
  " I tried to figure out a way to describe it so that she would understand",
  " I said I feel like I\u2019m holding onto a rope while I\u2019m dangling over a cliff",
  " Below me is a bottomless pit of darkness, above me is my life of darkness",
  " I\u2019ve been holding onto this rope for so long, struggling so hard not to fall, so afraid I will, so worn out",
  " Then one day I looked down at this bottomless pit of darkness, and looked up at my life of darkness",
  " I thought \u201cwhy am I struggling so hard not to fall",
  " There is nothing up there for me anymore, just unrelenting pain",
  " Holding on is becoming unbearable, it would be so easy to just let go of the rope\u201d",
  "Sometimes I would lie in bed for three days at a time",
  " I barely ate, my weight began to drop dramatically",
  " Life had no meaning anymore, it was just painful dead weight",
  " I could not cope with everything that was happening",
  " So what does a person do when they\u2019re suffering so much",
  " They try to end that suffering even if it means they\u2019ll die in the process",
  " It wasn\u2019t about wanting to die, I didn\u2019t want to die",
  " But I wanted so desperately to stop hurting",
  "So one day in desperation, feeling like this would be the way I\u2019d always feel, I mixed a cocktail of pills",
  " I had them in a glass ready to pour them down my throat",
  " But before I did I wanted to make sure I wouldn\u2019t go to hell if I killed myself",
  " I knew Jesus loved me, I learned that in Sunday school, but I felt abandoned by Him too",
  " I got the phone book out and searched the names of churches",
  " My intention was to speak to a pastor and ask him if I would go to hell if I killed myself, and if he said yes, I made up my mind to keep calling other churches until I got the answer I needed",
  " I needed the answer to be no, I needed permission to kill myself",
  " But God had other plans for me",
  " Out of all the churches listed, and there were a lot, I was guided to a specific church",
  " It was the first church I called and after speaking to a pastor, I didn\u2019t need to call any other churches",
  "A woman had answered the phone",
  " I asked her if I could talk to a pastor",
  " A man came on the line and asked me if he could help me",
  " I thought yes, somebody please help me",
  " But I came right to the point",
  " I asked him if I would go to hell if I killed myself",
  " He was silent for a moment",
  " He asked me to come to church that evening, that he would like to talk with me in person",
  " His whole demeanor was so comforting, something I needed in my life",
  " I almost changed my mind",
  " I didn\u2019t want to drag myself out of the house",
  " But something in his voice got me on my feet",
  " I met with him that evening at the church, we talked about everything I had been going through",
  " He gave me some books to read about healing the spirit",
  " He prayed for me and invited me to come back",

  " But I often began crying during services, still dealing with depression",
  "One evening as I was reading my bible, I began crying",
  " I wanted Jesus to hear me, to help me, to deliver me from this bondage of depression",
  " I got down on my knees and imagined myself at His feet as He was on the cross",
  " I begged His forgiveness",
  " I gave Him my shame, my guilt, my sadness, my hurt, everything I was feeling",
  " I laid it at His feet, and I prayed like I had never prayed before",
  "Now this is what I call my miracle",
  " I felt such a feeling of love encompass me",
  " I felt cocooned in love",
  " As I sat up, I felt like a weight had been lifted from me",
  " I stood up effortlessly, as if Jesus were lifting me to my feet",
  " When I walked it seemed like I was gliding",
  " I also felt like I was cradled in his arms",
  " I could actually feel the sensation of his arms around me, just this wonderful amazing tingling sensation of comfort",
  " It changed my life",

  " Free from ourselves, free from our own bondage",
  " There is sweet freedom in surrender, and I had surrendered it all to Him",
  "I couldn\u2019t wait to tell people",
  " I kept checking the bottom of my feet to see if there was some physical reason why I felt like I was gliding",
  " Nothing looked out of the ordinary, but it was an extraordinary feeling",
  " I\u2019d catch myself glancing at my shoulders just loving the feeling of comfort",
  " Halfway expecting to see someone\u2019s arms around me, but there was no one else there except Jesus",
  " I didn\u2019t have to see Him, I could feel Him",

  " I thought \u201cdo people know how amazing God is, what He\u2019s capable of doing\u201d",
  " I had never had a close relationship with Jesus before, but I was beginning to understand what that meant",
  "Someone warned me that I was on the mountain top right now, but there would be times I would be in the valley again",
  " But I didn\u2019t want to think about that",
  "I found out soon enough she was right",
  "God still allowed trials of depression in my life",
  " I found myself dangling over that cliff again, but I would hang onto that rope even harder now, I knew God had a plan for me, but I found my trust in Him wavering at times",
  " That\u2019s when I would cry out to Him",

  " He had a plan for me to get better",
  " I couldn\u2019t keep sitting on the sidelines waiting for God to fix everything",
  " That\u2019s not how it works",
  " So I decided to admit myself to a psychiatric hospital of my choice",
  " Somewhere I could confront my issues somewhere safe, somewhere people weren\u2019t exhausted with me",
  "I wasn\u2019t thrilled about going to another hospital, but I felt like that\u2019s what I needed to do",
  " I prayed to God to help me get through this, and He did",
  " It wasn\u2019t easy being in an environment like that again",
  " Most of the staff were indifferent and apathetic",
  " Not many people know how to deal with those suffering with depression",
  " I needed compassion, but was often met with intolerance and impatience by staff members",
  " I often cried, frustrated and upset with the treatment I received at the hands of some interns",
  " Attending group meetings was mandatory",
  " It was in this setting I found strength",
  " There were people there who had been hanging onto that rope too",
  " They had survived",
  " So could I",
  " God gave them the courage to cling to the rope and overcome their fears",
  " I knew He would do the same for me",
  "The psychiatrist was awesome",

  " He told me what people had done in the past to hurt me was on them, the burden was theirs not mine",
  " I needed to quit feeling guilty about things that were beyond my control",
  " He genuinely wanted me to get better, to live the life I deserved",

  " Jeremiah 29:11While I was still there I had noticed a girl walking through the hallways, something about her caught my eye",
  " She looked so sad and lost, she seemed so defeated",

  " So I wrote her a note",
  " I told her God loved her, that He is always there for her, I wrote things would get better",
  " I handed her the note as I passed her in the hall one day",
  " She looked at me with confusion, but I just went on past",
  " I didn\u2019t want to offend her or put her off by preaching to her",
  " I just wanted to give her something to think about",
  " I hadn\u2019t noticed her in the hallways after that, and thought she may have left",
  " But one day as I was waiting at the nurse\u2019s station, she walked over to me and thanked me, she said the note had helped her",

  " I never did see her after that",
  " I hope she found the peace she was looking for",
  " God had a purpose for me being there",
  "I went back home still feeling a little shaky",

  " If you do this you will experience God\u2019s peace, which is far more wonderful than the human mind can understand",
  " His peace will keep your thoughts and your hearts quiet and at rest as you trust in Jesus Christ",
  "I\u2019ve had to remind myself of that scripture many times",
  " It puts things into perspective for me",

  " I felt like God was trying to tell me something",
  " I had kept asking Him why I still had trials of depression, or asking Him why couldn\u2019t things just go back to the way they used to be",
  " I didn\u2019t understand",
  " But after reading that passage I understood",
  " I understood it was impossible for us to understand His decisions",
  " He wanted me to know it was impossible for us to try to figure Him out",
  " His ways and thoughts are so much higher than ours, beyond the scope of our understanding",
  " So I just had to calm down and trust Him",
  " I read that passage over several times wanting to make sure it was firmly planted in my mind",
  " After a few minutes I glanced up at the television",
  " My heart skipped a beat when I did",
  " The same passage I had been reading over and over filled up the entire screen",
  " Was it a freak coincidence someone had been talking about that same passage on television as I had been reading it in my bible",
  " No",
  " Nothing with God is a coincidence",
  " God knew this passage was important to me and wanted to make sure I got it",
  " He didn\u2019t want me to exhaust myself spiritually asking why all the time",
  " What a God moment",
  "He had His reasons for allowing trials in my life, I understood that now",
  " He was perfecting me",
  " God was teaching me things I needed to experience to gain knowledge for His plan",

  " I could almost hear the giggles as I lifted the lid bit by bit",
  " Here\u2019s Joy",
  " Oh how I had missed joy",
  " I closed my eyes and took in its sweet scent, it smelled of lilacs and bubblegum",
  " I found merriment tucked between Christmas and birthdays",

  " Oh",
  " One of my favorites",
  " The gift of wonder, I had spent countless hours looking through its kaleidoscope of mystery and magic",

  " It\u2019s sometimes harder to forgive yourself than it is others",
  " But I remind myself I am a child of God",
  " Like all children I made many mistakes, but God always forgave me",
  " If God almighty can forgive me I can learn to forgive myself too",
  " It would be impossible for me to fulfill His purpose for me if I were dragging the baggage of unforgiveness behind me",

  "The difference was hard for me to grasp",

  " It was summer break, we were having our holidays, until I got a notification that someone got my LINE id",
  " At first I was confused, cause I rarely use LINE anymore and i thought i added everyone in class, so i thought this person was a random dude who probably got the wrong ID",
  " But when he started chatting, he mentioned about a classmate, he told me that his friend liked my friend and at first i thought it was pretty weird, but when he started talking his native language, I directly knew who he was",
  " He was the guy in 6th grade, the quiet one",
  " I was shook",
  " I didn&#8217;t know why he added me, and why he even started a conversation with me",
  " By surprise, we started to talk all summer break until our school started",
  " We would joke around that we don&#8217;t want to be in the same classes and by chance, we made it in the same class",
  " So when school started, we acted as if we never talked, it was like our own little secret",
  " And of course, even when school started, we still talk to each other everyday, till it became a daily routine",
  " Until one day, I started to have feelings for him, I didn&#8217;t know how, but my feelings for him are slowly growing but I didn&#8217;t want our friendship to end",
  " So, I decided to stay away from him and shut down my whole social media since I was too afraid to commit",
  " He started to get anxious, but for some reason he never has the guts to talk to me at school",
  " I didn&#8217;t like that, he&#8217;s acting as if i&#8217;m a stranger to him, I didn&#8217;t want to get hurt so I had to be less attached to him than I already was",
  " I waited for a few weeks until I had the courage to open my social medias again",
  " My line messages were filled with a lot of messages, including him getting worried",
  " I started to open up and played it cool",
  " I couldn&#8217;t avoid him anymore so I had no other choice",
  " The next few weeks, one day before my birthday, we were playing a simple game, it was about truth or truth",
  " He made it up, so we actually had to say the truth",
  " without a doubt I was nervous",
  " At first, the questions were really simple, like &#8220;what&#8217;s your favourite colour&#8221; or &#8220;what is your full name&#8221; which of course we knew",
  " However things started to escalate, he started to ask questions relating on who I find interesting, and I didn&#8217;t want to tell him directly, so i made him guess",
  " He was very insecure, cause he thought that there&#8217;s someone else that I like since there was this one boy that was basically everyone&#8217;s crush in the class, but i lost interest since he played with my feelings too much",
  " And so, i just blurted out his name and he went silent for a good 5 minutes",
  " Until I had to break the silence, I cut to the point and asked &#8220;who do you like&#8221; and he said &#8220;you&#8221;After that, we became a thing, we were happy and everything was going great",
  " We kept it a secret, since people wouldn&#8217;t really believe me anyways that if i were with him",
  " Most of the girls in my class likes him, so i was pretty glad he chose me",
  " Our relationship wasn&#8217;t toxic, no one got in the way just yet and I kept thinking to myself how lucky I was to get him",
  " But of course in the middle of every story, there would be a problem",
  " Before I continue I don&#8217;t want you to get the wrong point of view of my friend here, I was completely okay with them being friends since he had every right to talk to anyone, who am i to stop him",
  " So there&#8217;s this one girl, let&#8217;s just give her the name star, star was a new students in the class, she just moved and she was very out going, she had senior friends already and already made half of the class like her",
  " Until she had one more goal, which one being friends with &#8216;him&#8217;",
  " She told me about it, and said some things which I find really uncomfortable, she was talking about his part of bodies",
  " I stayed silent since i didn&#8217;t want to make it obvious",
  " Each day, start progressively gets his trust and literally held hands in front of me, even I never did that or even talked to him",
  " I was heart broken at that time but I never let anyone knew about it since they wouldn&#8217;t believe me",
  " At lunch I would rarely cry in the bathroom and skip my lunch so I can loose weight and that I can maybe feel better of myself",
  " It did, but the consequences were irreversible",
  " All I could do was cry in the toilet because I kept it to myself",
  " One time, I got so mad that i started to cry in class but I pretended i was yawning so it wouldn&#8217;t be obvious",
  " I didn&#8217;t want him to think that I&#8217;m dramatic, because all i wanted is the same amount of energy he&#8217;s giving her to me at school",
  " I eventually told him how I felt and he didn&#8217;t like it",
  " He told me i&#8217;m being dramatic and told me that she&#8217;s just a friend",
  " I was hurt, but i had to pretend",
  " so i just said sorry and left",
  " On January 29 2018, we broke all contacts, i would message him daily, but all he did was just reading them, to the point i wanted to give up, but I can&#8217;t",
  " So on a Friday, i gathered all my courage to ask if he lost feelings for me",
  " Without hesitation he said &#8220;yes&#8221; inside i was broken, numb, betrayed, he made a promise to me that he won&#8217;t hurt me or that he won&#8217;t leave me",
  "  Pft how naive was I to believe what he said",
  " He explained that there&#8217;s another girl that he has eyes for and wants to be with her, i accepted that decision, and just supported him",
  " Until he started to talk bad about me and was so ashamed to be my &#8216;boyfriend&#8217; he kept saying &#8220;oh those texts were fake, i used an app to write those to her&#8221; and so star made fun of me because she thought i was lying",
  " She kept laughing about it, saying how pathetic I was",
  " Before we go up to 8th grade, he decided to move to another school",
  " One of my friend&#8217;s brother is very close with him, and knows his secret",
  " One time, he told my friend&#8217;s brother that she likes a girl in our class, and she was star",
  " I wasn&#8217;t shocked, but i was just heartbroken and i feel betrayed",
  " Since star liked him, and told me to help her get together with him",
  " I did, i told him that she likes him and he just read, and so star lost feelings THAT EASILY",
  " I was obviously pissed but it&#8217;s not my business",
  " I just wanted him to be happy, and find someone better in his life, and I wish he just wasn&#8217;t that ashamed to be together with me",
  " Thanks for being there with me M",

  " Nevertheless, the more I opposed the stronger they came",
  " Another bank levy came in the mail, though thankfully by that time I had already switched from direct deposit to paper checks",

  "\u201d Sadly, after weeks of searching for alternatives, I finally swallowed my pride and proceeded with the withdrawal using my Medical Tuition Credit",
  "I cried that entire week, thinking back to the substantial amount of tribulation I endured during that one semester",
  " How much I sacrificed just to make the grade",
  " All those unsolicited trips to the library, using the little money I had for food and laundry to make copies of 5-page papers for class; Regularly catching colds from long walks to and from each campus building in snowy, below-freezing temperatures; The soles of my shoes coming apart from walking too much; getting lost in Milwaukee around midnight alone in the freezing cold with a dead phone; utilizing the school\u2019s food pantry; and that one time I had to file a police report when my wallet was stolen with all my money, driver\u2019s license and dorm keys",
  " It was never found",
  " Coincidentally\u2014around December\u2014I came face to face with the University Chancellor through an unexpected encounter with someone in close connection with me",
  " He was told that my bank account had been levied twice; my grades and 3",
  "3 GPA were withdrawn under compulsion since I never received financial aid to cover my tuition and I was still misclassified as a non-resident student resulting in no state or federal grant funding",

  "\u201d he exclaimed, seeming concerned",
  " \u201cAs soon as I get back to my office, I will look into it",
  "\u201dI was relieved when I heard the news",
  " Finally",
  " After over a year of being out of school, going back and forth with UWM regarding my proof of residency and refunding the bank levy, it had finally come to an end; or so I thought",
  " A month had already gone by and still nothing had been done",
  " In the meantime, my classes and all charges associated with tuition for fall 2018 had been successfully removed from my school account; all except housing",
  "In mid-January 2020, I filed a Financial Appeal Process to remove any remaining charges from my account, only to find out that the process takes 120 days from the date the charges were posted for my appeal to be reviewed",
  " Fortunately, by that time I managed to get in touch with a journalist from a major local newspaper to take my story and expose the truth",
  " As soon as the article was published that same week, I immediately received a letter from the Residential Accounts Manager and Chair of the Appeals Committee to inform me that my University Housing Appeal was approved and the remaining outstanding balance of $1,524",
  "48 was removed based on the \u201cextenuating circumstances\u201d provided",
  "At last, my account that once held a balance of over $15,000 in tuition was reduced to zero",
  " Praise God",
  " I couldn\u2019t have been happier to know that a HUGE weight I carried for over a year had finally been lifted off my shoulders",
  " I no longer owned UWM a dime",
  " However, UWM still owed me considerably for the money they unrightfully stole from my family",
  " I had to get my money back",
  "Over the next couple of weeks, I got back in touch with the Associate Dean of Students to request a refund of the money they bank levied for the tuition I once owed them",
  " My request was adamantly denied in an email stating, \u201cYou do not owe UWM any monies",
  " However, the committee was unable to justify refunding any amount that you had already paid because you &#091;lived&#093; in University Housing for the entire fall 2018 semester",
  " In other words, you will not be refunded any of the monies that you have already paid\u2026\u201dAfter reading the response, I grew hot with anger",
  " I felt that I had totally lost any sort of consideration and attentiveness from UWM since they thought removing the charges would solve everything",
  " I gave up",
  " Here I was, almost two years older than I was when I enrolled at UWM, out of school with no grades",
  " If I can\u2019t get the Chancellor or the Associate Dean to listen to me, then who can I ask",
  " Who can I turn to",
  " Then, out of the blue \u2013 a week later, I received another email from the Associate Dean, this time stating that the refund of $1,579",
  "47 I requested would be returned to me in full",
  " Wait a minute, I thought, what made her change her mind so fast and why",
  " Turns out, my mother went behind my back and contacted the university Chancellor for herself",
  " \u201cAs a parent, I respectfully ask you to please reconsider my refund request of $1,579",
  "47; my daughter&#8217;s name was on the account, but it is my earnings",
  "\u201dI wasn\u2019t sure whether to be shocked, embarrassed or offended that my mother did this without my knowing and UWM took her word over mine, but I sure was proud of her and appreciative that she stood up for me when I needed it most",
  " Slowly, I was starting to regain all I had lost from one semester",
  " Now, it was my grades",
  "This is when I need your help, Reader",
  " Think about it",
  " What would you do if an institution misclassified you as a non-resident student in the state where you were born and have been a lifelong resident",
  " How would you like it if you were a low-income student and denied any financial assistance including financial aid, state and federal grant funding or local scholarships because of the mistake they made",
  " Wouldn\u2019t you feel upset if a university went into your bank account and swiped all the money you saved for food and gas",
  " If you were forced to withdraw your grades to remove unnecessary charges from your account, what would you choose",
  " At this moment, I choose my grades",

  "I grew up in a family/community that relegated women and girls for example, when men spoke, women are to remain silent or take the blame for everything whether they are right or wrong",
  " Most times, they woke up as early as 4am to go to the family farmland, working from dawn to dusk, walking through lonely bush paths and having no time for themselves",
  " They were at the mercy of men",
  " Girls on the other hand weren&#8217;t privileged to go to school because everyone thought that girl so education was a waste of time as they will end up in the kitchen or in a man&#8217;s house giving birth",
  " On the other hand, my dad never really shares same school of thought with &#8216;everyone&#8217; who never believed in not empowering women and girls however, he was so poor that he couldn&#8217;t fend for my educational needs",
  " I struggled through school as I wore tattered school uniform, had old notebooks, didn&#8217;t even have a pen to write in class and wore very old oversized school sandals",
  " Most times, my teacher would bring me out in front if the whole class to scold me, my classmates always made mockery of me and I was usually sent home thereby missing classes, test and even exams",
  "Whenever the new school term resumes, I never resumed on time because my dad couldn&#8217;t pay my fees or other school related levies",
  " I was broken, stressed, sad and depressed",
  " However, there was nothing anyone could do after all, girls education wasn&#8217;t supported",
  " On this fateful day, I had so many thoughts about changing the narrative",
  " What if people saw girls education as normal as boys",
  " What if people put in more resources to support women empowerment, girls right and opportunities",
  " What if everyone sees these things from a different light",
  " I will was determined to make that change happen because no one was ready to &#8220;bell the cat&#8221;",
  "Fortunately, after struggling to get into the University, I knew I had to start from somewhere if I wanted to really change the narrative and in my 3rd year at the University on my bed, I founded Youngpearl Organization",
  " Youngpearl Organization is a community based NGO which I use to advocate for the rights and privileges as well as improve the lives and well-being of marginalized and underprivileged women and girls in rural communities across Nigeria",
  " Women and girls at the grassroot level suffer the most relegation, marginalization, setback and all forms of violence",
  " I have been there so I know how it feels",
  " Right now, I advance girls education by providing educational learning materials, sanitary pads and scholarships for educationally disadvantaged girls to have access to inclusive quality education, I also organize skill training programs for women where they learn various handwork of their choice so that they can start up a local business and become financially independent",
  " Furthermore, I mentor young girls and women to build their capacities and monitor their progress in their various regions",
  " Additionally, I established a school in my community called Sunrise Academy which enables rural children especially girls learn in a safe and conducive environment, connect to their peers, bond and Excel",

  "I was born and raised in Germany in a patriarchal Turkish household",
  " My parents emigrated there before my birth",
  " At 19, I was arranged married to a relative who mentally and physically abused me for making fundamental life decisions such as wanting to get an education and a job",
  " Despite witnessing the domestic violence, my parents rejected my wish to get a divorce and not only insisted I had to be obedient but accused me of abandoning my culture and traditions by wanting to adopt a Western lifestyle",
  " As the oldest of three girls and one brother, I refused the idea that my reality was to be the reality for my sisters, nor did I want to see my brother grow up in an environment in which he did not learn to respect women",
  " I felt particularly let down by the lack of support from the females in my family who had, at the very least, grown up in Germany, yet failed to challenge the male oppression",
  " One early morning with only the clothes on my back, and a binder with my documents under my arm, I abandoned my husband&#8217;s house and found refuge in a women shelter",
  " I knew that I injured the &#8220;sense of honor&#8221; of both my husband and my family, particularly of my father, by undermining their authority",
  " Fearing for my safety from a husband eager to retaliate, I frequently moved from one women&#8217;s shelter to another",
  " My parents disowned me, and I was forbidden to talk to my siblings and had to communicate with them in secret for seven years",
  " During my time in the women shelters, I met women from around the world who were victims of domestic abuse",
  " Most had little to no German skills preventing them from defending themselves or share their experience",
  " Elementary English became the language we communicate in, and I was able to help them fill out legal documents or document their experience",
  " This motivated me to learn English and French professionally",
  " I enrolled at a private language institute to become a foreign language correspondent",
  " I was driven to forge a new path and become financially independent, not only for me but for my siblings",
  " I worked three jobs simultaneously to pay for living expenses and tuition and spend many nights falling asleep on top of my dictionaries doing homework",
  " My language skills opened the doors to a career at a global airline, a life in New York, and the opportunity to attend NYU",
  " Most importantly, I was able to demonstrate to my siblings that any woman could build an agency for herself",
  " Confident of my support, they challenged all forms of patriarchy in our family and forced my parents to overcame their identity crisis of living in two opposing cultures and began to change their behavior towards each other and their parenting style towards my siblings",
  " Consequently, my sisters grew up with the same opportunities and freedoms afforded to their German peers",

  "Dedication: To my friends who helped me find myself againI was always unhealthily obsessed with a guy since sixth grade",
  " We made it very clear that we hated each other, always fighting, always telling everyone else how much the other person sucked",
  " It was about tiny things, like memes, friends, school, etc",
  " There wasn&#8217;t really a reason why we did, it was just that we argued back and forth for hours every day",
  " Everyone knew that we could never stop arguing",
  " But I had a secret: deep down, I kinda liked him",
  " It was totally weird and embarrassing and only one of my not-so-close friend knew",
  " I wasn\u2019t possessive or head over heels, it was just that something about him was different, and it attracted me",
  " I started feeling insecure, and I felt that something was terribly wrong with me",
  " It took forever to get over him",
  " First step was stop talking, and over and over, I kept adding him back after I deleted him",
  " When I finally did that, I decided my next step was to accept that I was a great person",
  " I kept feeling terrible, knowing that I used to like \u201csuch a jerk\u201d",
  " After a lot of help from my friends, I was back on my feet",
  " The last step was becoming me again",
  " What he\u2019d said, his constan judgement, and though I\u2019d ignored it, had somewhat changed me",
  " I suddenly felt that emojis were lame, complimenting people always needed to be tinged with sarcasm, and that most of my former friends were idiots",
  " But that was him, all along it was him, turning me into someone I wasn\u2019t",
  " I can\u2019t say that I don\u2019t think of him now, that I completely reverted back to the old me",
  " And no, I\u2019m not playing the victim either",
  " I simply want more girls to know that you are wonderful and excellent as you are, and these boys that insult you, manipulate you, without ever actually loving you, is not worth it",

  " I know how I am, you can\u2019t judge me, you probably have a different position in this world and that is the ignorance that we all have this nature in every aspect of our lives, people will compile conspiracy by being offended or hurt for raising my voice for realistic transparency, so we as Muslims have never had the rights to be worthed, we have never had the respect we wanted,we have never really been understood by anyone, so we have been subjected to all kinds of oppression for years, or we have been harmed and abused because of the religion we belong to,what a misfortune",

  "but i swear On God with great sincerity that we as Muslims who are devoted to the Islamic religion would not bring such an unbearable chaos,and in this way you took the words of the hypocrites and put them in your hearts towards us, I have never felt in terrible pain than when people are hurt because of their innocence unbeliveable, it is something disgusting non-humanitarian,the existence of the feelings of these people is not at all you have no grief for the pain caused to the Muslims",

  "Dedication: My DadHi",
  " I&#8217;m a 20 year old medical student from South India",
  " I was always pampered as kid owing to the fact that I was the only child",
  "I had everything growing up be it wealth, health or laughter",
  " But things started changing from middle school",
  " My dad who was a successful businessman fell ill due to which he suffered in his business",
  " My father&#8217;s family started drifting apart due to our financial conditions and stopped considering us a part of them",
  " My dad suffered from depression during this phase as his family had given up on him",
  " The impact of his depression was experienced by my mother and I",
  " As a 13 year old kid I would pray to God to return back home and find my dad alive",
  " I slowly started drifting apart from my friends be it because of what I was going through at home or because my friends no longer considered my a match to their level",
  " It kinda hurt me as a teen seeing people easily giving up on you because of materialistic stuff",
  " My mom and I supported my dad through this misery as a result of which he got through a sad phase and emerged a happy man who was able to rebuild his career and his position in his family",
  " He started a new firm and worked twice as hard to clear our debts and construct a new life for us",
  " Today he is more successful than he was when he failed in his business",
  " His family respects him for who he is and not for his money, his colleagues have great respect for him and I couldn&#8217;t be more proud of my hero",
  "He was able to send me to best of colleagues to pursue the career I wanted and save enough money to buy a new car and a luxurious house",
  "Don&#8217;t give up, there&#8217;s something better out there for you",
  "",
  "Dedication: Dedicated to Swan, for being my only supporter during all of this \u2764\ufe0fI was always an anxious person",
  " From the time I was very little I always worried about everything, in ways that nobody could ever understand",
  " I would cry over things that people would think you would never cry over",
  " My anxiety always was a target for people didn\u2019t understand and would make fun of me, including my own parents",
  " They were never supported me through my struggles and would always scream and even go as far as to get violent whenever I would have panic attacks and cry",
  " I\u2019ve been to so many therapists but they never understood me because my parents would always talk to them first and tell them how much of a bad person I am and how I\u2019m destroying their life",
  " People in my high school would start rumors about me and pretend to be nice when in reality they were all joking about how weird and schizophrenic I was (I am not, and have never been diagnosed with that)",
  " This rumor even ended up going as far as to reach a job I had outside of school",
  " This led me to always have my guard up, but not enough",
  "I used to always try to see the good in people, but I realized it would end up hurting me a lot in the end",
  " I went away to a small college upstate, mainly because it was the only school that accepted me and I wanted to get away from my toxic parents",
  " Little did I know that this school would cause my mental health to start rapidly deteriorating",
  " I met some of the worst people in my life when I was there",
  " I was told multiple times by people in my dorm hall to kill myself",
  " I will never forget the time I took a chance and went away with my roommate during the Labor Day weekend to her hometown",
  " She brought some of our other roommates with her as well",
  " We all started to drink, and soon after one of my roommates decided out of no where to start messing with me and making fun of me because of the way I walked while drunk",
  " I didn\u2019t understand why she was doing this because I didn\u2019t know her",
  " I never had a full on conversation with her and she just decided in the middle of nowhere, where I had no way of leaving, that she would start talking about how shitty I am and how she didn\u2019t like me",
  " She started getting some other people to start doing the same and soon I had a full blown panic attack somewhere that I was unfamiliar with, with people i either didn\u2019t know or only knew for less than 2 weeks",
  " We weren\u2019t even supposed to leave the day after, as we planned to go to a local fair",
  " I remember being so miserable, refusing to take pictures with any of them and going to to the smoke area to cry",
  " I ended up having to switch rooms 3 more times during my stay",
  " One of my roommates would let random people walk into our room when they weren\u2019t there",
  " I tried to explain to her how uncomfortable it was making me to have strangers walk into my own room without even knocking, but she could never listen",
  " I was accused of stealing from someone I thought was friend, was told to kill myself on multiple occasions, was accused of being racist for absolutely no reason, was the only person out of a group of 7 people to be threatened with suspension for something we were all doing, and not a day goes by that I don\u2019t think about how terrible my experience was there",
  "People always say how college is supposed to be the best time of your life, how you\u2019re supposed to find yourself and the best people you will ever meet",
  " To this day I\u2019ve never met anyone who had a terrible college experience",
  " And I feel like I can never find someone who will relate to this",
  " I wished college would\u2019ve been the best thing for me, but it turned out to be one of the worst experiences I\u2019ve ever had in my life",
  " It was filled with constant anxiety and worrying because I knew I had people out to get me, whether it was to use me for rides/money or try to befriend me in order to gossip with others about what I said",
  " After I left and came back home I was never the same",
  " I became severely depressed and stopped talking to a lot of people, some friends",
  " I hate the life that I have now, still living with my abusive toxic parents an unable to even move out due to the pandemic",
  " I always think the worst in people now, and I just stopped trying to better myself",
  " I feel like I\u2019m not good at anything in life, and that there\u2019s always better people than me",
  " I\u2019m so terrified to put myself out there in case I get made fun of and ridiculed",
  " I know that I shouldn\u2019t hold myself back but the thought of the feelings I had when I was humiliated everyday somewhere that I lived for almost a year kills me",
  " I really hate sharing my story to others because people always look at me and say that I want others to feel bad for me",
  " That I\u2019m a drama queen who\u2019s always putting on an act",
  " (I remember even being called one by a teacher at school in third grade, I was an eight year old who was already being told that my anxiety didn\u2019t matter) But that is far from the truth",
  " I hate attention more than anything in the world",
  " I never even post pictures of myself online because I hate people looking at me, and everything about myself",
  " The last thing I\u2019d ever want is attention from people or to have people pity me",
  " But I feel like this is my only shot at sharing my story that has been eating away at me for the longest time",
  " It\u2019s been almost a year since I left this school, but I still causes me a tremendous amount of pain everything I think back to it",
  " I wish to someday be a different person and put it all in the past, but I don\u2019t know how I can ever do that",
  "",
  "There were changes in body after post- pregnancy",
  " My body was not moving, and I had a lot of pain in my bones",
  " My husband consulted so many doctors but there was no improvement",
  " Doctors told that it will be throughout the life&#8230;my problem was increasing day by day",
  " My family didn&#8217;t help me",
  " Even I was not able to walk properly",
  "No one was there to look after my baby,I was not able to feed my baby on time,the duration of feeding of my baby was long",
  "but she never cried,may be she was understanding my problem",
  " All medicine like Alopathe, ayurved became failed",
  " I felt that I will never stand on my legs,but I didn&#8217;t lose my hope because I was thinking only about my baby",
  " I have to be cured any how for my baby",
  " I kept me mentally strong",
  "  I tried to walk against my body, and bear the pain",
  " Only one thing was in my mind I had to get rid of my problem to back in normal life only for my baby",
  " Where there is a will there is way&#8230; at the time when all the doctors said no, I promised myself to be back by own",
  "Then I started my routines",
  " It took five years and now I am a fitness trainer",
  "",
  " there was a time when I was not able to move and having multiple health issues but now I am working others to be fit",
  " I am amazing because having a lot of problems with me but I never lose my hope and bounce back in life",

  "As we reflect on how to commence this article and share reflections and musings on the COVID-19 situation and its impact on the reproductive health and rights of women and girls in Kenya, a particular statement sticks out &#8211; leaving no one behind",
  " It sounds quite abstract unless you have been in a position where you \u2018felt\u2019 left behind or you were literally left behind",
  " It is a term that human rights advocates and activists use quite often whilst promoting and protecting inclusivity in the human rights based approach",
  "Many women and girls in Africa have been left behind when it comes to  accessing reproductive health services ",
  " This is partly due to stigma, lack of economic means, lack of information on where and how to access reproductive health services and products",
  " The COVID-19 pandemic has made it worse as lockdowns, job losses and movement restrictions have led to difficulty in accessing reproductive health services",
  " Many hospitals and health centers have given priority to COVID-19 and for those that still attend to reproductive health matters, extra measures have been put in place making previously short hospital visits take longer than usual which discourages many from going to hospitals",
  " Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, several reports both online and offline have highlighted stories of women, girls, women led households and the impact of Corona on a wide array of issues related to the wellness and wellbeing of those affected",
  " Kenyans on social media in particular have been very effective in highlighting some of these cases as well as starting crowdfunding initiatives to support these women",
  " The Daily Nation, a Kenyan newspaper, highlighted the story of Nduku, a woman who lost her life due to lack of access to a health facility and maternity services to help her give birth to her seventh child",
  " She died because bodaboda operators were afraid of police harassment \u2013 even though this was a medical emergency exempted from the curfew restrictions \u2013 they just did not know and were afraid",
  " They resorted to traditional birth attendants who were unable to assist her",
  " She had to wait till morning hours so she could finally access a health center",
  " By then, the complications had progressed, she needed blood, there was none, by 2 p",
  "m",
  " her family was informed that she had passed on",
  "On 6th May, K24, one of Kenya\u2019s television stations reported that a  27-year-old mother of two who was kicked out of her house in Mihango, Nairobi was gang raped by thugs in front of her children at an unfinished building where she took shelter",
  "  Her business of hawking fruits on Mombasa Road, had been hit hard by COVID-19 pandemic as customers dwindled and prices for stock spiked",
  " This led to her being unable to pay her rent and she was kicked out of the house forcing her to seek shelter in the unfinished building",
  "The story of Wambui from Korogocho Grogon B Informal settlements, highlighted by activist Boniface Mwangi and the Kenya Human Rights Commission is worth mentioning",
  " Her house barely without a roof, toilet and barely any house furniture one envisions when you visualise home",
  " Like many women across the country, Wambui\u2019s story is one that reminds us of the economic strain the corona virus has had on women",
  " This economic strain has led many to prioritise feeding their families at the expense of  their reproductive health needs",
  "These three stories show how the coronavirus pandemic has affected women&#8217;s lives",
  "  The stories demonstrate that the pandemic is undoubtedly a reproductive health complication and as such responses across the world including Kenya should be founded on protecting the Right to Health and as such Health related prevention and management means and structures the key tools for the response",
  " We laud the efforts of the various global and local organisations that have adapted their strategies  to ensure women and girls in Kenya still have access to their reproductive needs",
  " KELIN Kenya, CREAW and Katiba are jointly offering free legal services for gender based violence victims during COVID-19",
  " Hotlines such as TICAH Kenya\u2019s Aunty Jane Hotline and Reproductive Health Network\u2019s Nena Na Binti can be accessed through phone calls",
  " For those who prefer getting information online, platforms like safe2choose and FindMyMethod are a great resource",
  "The Right to Health is provided for under our Constitution in Article 43 (1) (a) that provides, every person has the right to the highest attainable standard of health, which includes the right to healthcare services, including reproductive health care",
  " This provision asserts the inclusion of every person \u2013 man, woman, child",
  " However, this is not the actual situation on the ground",
  "  The onus is on us as Individuals, Government and activists to ensure that the right to a decent life for women is achievable even during this pandemic",
  " The reproductive health needs of women have not taken a break simply because there is a pandemic",
  "",
  "Telling my story might help me heal and maybe help someone else in the process",
  " We read other people&#8217;s stories all the time",
  " This is just mine",
  " I don\u2019t like to tell my story because I don\u2019t want it to be the Susanne show",
  " I\u2019d actually rather be invisible",
  " My parents were strangers and so ill equipped",
  " &#8211; no parenting skills, no support except from other drunk people, no money, mom was mentally ill (they didn&#8217;t know how to treat it then) and they were both drunk, all the time",
  " And she&#8217;d play pharmacist with different pill cocktails",
  "  She would get physically sick and just stay in bed and he just passed out &#8211; like every day",
  "We were feral children",
  " If we didn&#8217;t feed ourselves, it didn&#8217;t happen",
  " Neighbors took pity on us and fed us once in a while which only added to the shame",
  " Everyone knew our household was a disaster",
  " We were dirty, disappointed, ashamed, but mostly we were scared, all the time",
  " Here are some of the highlights",
  " My parents separated 9 times from between first grade and seventh &#8211; fighting, we&#8217;d move out, new school, then back again",
  " I was put in the berry fields at 6 years old picking berries because my mother couldn&#8217;t deal with her children &#8211; only to have them take what money we did earn",
  " Didn&#8217;t have money for food but the whiskey and cigarettes were plentiful",
  " Dad went to jail &#8211; drunk driving",
  " Mom went to a mental hospital &#8211; got shock treatments &#8211; forgot who we were",
  " My sister tried took my dad\u2019s 357 magnum and pointed it at my dad friend &#8211; at 10 years old",
  " There were two house fires &#8211; both the result of passed out drunk while smoking",
  " The first one we put out as a family and my dad rebuilt the damage because he was a carpenter",
  " The second one, dad was gone",
  " Mom passed out smoking and woke up to her hair and the bed on fire",
  " When we woke up to the fire trucks, we thought she was in there but there&#8217;s the added bonus of bullets flying everywhere because doesn&#8217;t everyone keep ammo in their bedroom",
  " It was terrifying",
  " As a result, the family split again only this time my sisters stayed with my dad",
  " That left me to take care of my mom, daily vitamin b shots for her alcoholism, cooking, cleaning",
  " I was 11",
  "The hits go on and on but the point is, that was never going to happen to me, not ever",
  " They eventually separated for good, both stopped drinking, and were incredibly wonderful people",
  " They really did do the best they could but it took me years to understand that",
  "Fast forward to high school, my sisters drank but I never did",
  " I would go to the keggers because anyone who was anyone was there then I&#8217;d stand in judgement of everyone that was drinking",
  " The beginning of a long career of comparing &#8211; ranking people, myself included, on the scale of good or bad, better or worse",
  " Where do I fit in on that spectrum",
  "College &#8211; had  a sip or two",
  " Didn&#8217;t like the taste, still full of fear about becoming alcoholic, and not drinking enough to feel the effects so no motivation to try",
  "First drunk &#8211; home for the weekend for a party",
  " My step sister knew I didn&#8217;t drink but gave me a dare",
  " She filled a red solo cup with red wine and said &#8211; bet you can&#8217;t drink that in 7 gulps",
  " And, being the good future alcoholic that I was, WATCH me",
  " That was the first and only time I threw up as a result of my drinking",
  " I had one hangover in my life",
  " No consequences to deter me",
  "Eventually I found a few cocktails that I could choke down and would have one from time to time but I was still ok",
  "Met my husband &#8211; what drew me to him was that he was serious, stable, successful, husband material",
  " Did I love him",
  " Probably",
  " But he was better than the losers or shall I say &#8220;free spirits&#8221; I had dated before",
  " And he was my ticket to the life I always wanted",
  "We dated, went out for dinner, he&#8217;d pick me up at work for lunch, we&#8217;d see live music, theater, golf, he&#8217;d take days off to be with me",
  " Life was perfect",
  " Then we got engaged and it all changed",
  "He began working 12-14 hours a day, 6-7 days a week, traveling, lying to me, manipulating me, controlling me",
  " But I didn&#8217;t see it because I had faith in the fairytale and in him",
  " And, I&#8217;d made a commitment",
  "Things were Ok until out of the blue, after 17 years of sobriety, my dad killed himself and drank the day he died",
  " We were absolutely destroyed",
  " He was the anchor in our family",
  " That was truly the beginning of the end for me",
  "We began spending time with his brother",
  " By now I was 29",
  " My sisters had figured out they were alcoholic and stopped drinking but not me",
  " I was just getting started",
  " My aunt drank wine which I thought was very sophisticated",
  " She would offer it and I would accept",
  " Nothing wrong with that",
  " And I began to change",
  " I began to realize what alcohol did for me",
  "In the midst of my grief, I thought it would be a great time to have a baby",
  " So we did",
  " I gave up my business to be a stay home mom &#8211; again fulfilling my dream or so I thought",
  " But my husband was absent",
  " It worked while I had a job and social interaction but by now, I was alone",
  " He had alienated all my friends and family",
  " I had no one",
  " He was gone and I had this baby",
  " And I wanted to die",
  " I couldn&#8217;t get a divorce because that would ruin the dream and I&#8217;d made a commitment, I couldn&#8217;t kill myself because my sisters and I made an agreement that we never would, and I couldn&#8217;t live like this for the next 50 years",
  " I felt trapped and crazy",
  " I had everything I ever thought I wanted, everything that most people want",
  " I had a beautiful new home, a house on Mt",
  " Hood, new furniture, new cars, loving husband that made a ton of money, healthy baby but yet I wanted to die",
  "Then this amazing thing called the internet came along and ignited my addiction",
  " I became obsessively involved with chat rooms and landed in a local chat room",
  " These people got together Saturday nights to drink, dance, etc",
  " Emphasis on the etc",
  " I decided to go one time, to put names to faces, and I was the belle of the ball",
  " But in order to be the belle of the ball, I had to have liquid courage",
  " They thought I was smart, funny, beautiful, and after a few drinks, I believed them",
  " And better yet, they had flexible values and morals and made my increasingly awful behavior Ok",
  " And I&#8217;d wake up Sunday morning, back to being Martha Stewart, not hung over, I got away with it",
  " I got the attention I needed and wasn&#8217;t getting at home and that worked for a while",
  "I started having some consequences as a result of my drinking and at one point, I decided that all my problems in my marriage were because I drank and AA was going to fix everything",
  " I went to a meeting or two, got a sponsor for a minute, then despite couples therapy and effort, we separated and ultimately divorced",
  " I had no child care for meetings so I stopped and that was that",
  "But, I didn&#8217;t drink for 8 months",
  " And being away from the marriage, I felt relief and I felt free",
  " But as one does, I figured I&#8217;ve gone all this time, surely I can drink like a lady now",
  " Spoiler alert",
  " Didn&#8217;t happen",
  " Eventually I got away from the internet crowd and replaced them with a poker playing crowd",
  " We&#8217;d sit in bars and play Texas hold em every night",
  " I thought because I was sitting between a pastor and a cop who eventually became my boyfriend, this was a wholesome activity",
  " And I never considered that I might have a problem",
  " I seldom drank around my daughter",
  " I only drank when she was with her dad &#8211; which was half the time",
  " She saw me drunk one time when we were on vacation",
  " I had a big, important job, owned my house, had a few nickels to rub together, and didn&#8217;t drink like my parents so I was good",
  "Over time, I kind of figured out that I didn&#8217;t really like my boyfriend but he encouraged my drinking and because he was a cop, always drove me home",
  " Well, he dumped me because I treated him horribly and would get mean when I was drunk",
  " Over the course of 3 days, he dumped me, I got laid off, and I was being sued for rear ending someone",
  " So, I drank",
  " Except now I didn&#8217;t have a driver so I got arrested",
  " I was ",
  "24 &#8211; should not have been conscious",
  " And the crazy thing is I&#8217;d been way more drunk and driven home before",
  "So I spent a night in jail and went to an AA meeting the next day &#8211; not because I wanted to quit drinking but I figured my sister wouldn&#8217;t kill me if I did SOMETHING cuz she was good and pissed",
  "So I went to meetings &#8211; a lot of them &#8211; because I had nothing else to do",
  " No job",
  " Couldn&#8217;t drink",
  " Couldn&#8217;t drive",
  " And it was the only place I could shut my head up",
  " So I&#8217;d get my daughter off to school, go back to bed, go to a noon meeting, go back to bed, get her from school, be a mom, go to an evening meeting, lather, rinse repeat",
  " I got a sponsor",
  " I worked the steps, and over time came to believe that you were my people",
  " You made my horrible behavior Ok but not in a way that allowed me to continue and do worse, but in a way that allowed me to forgive myself and heal, because it&#8217;s just what we do when we are in our disease",
  " You helped me realize that I&#8217;m not a horrible person",
  " I&#8217;ve just done horrible things",
  " It&#8217;s not who I am but what I&#8217;ve done",
  " And, I spend my life now living with intention and making amends",
  " When my grandma died, I could barely run in and say goodbye because I had someone in the car waiting for me so we could go drinking",
  " When my mother died two years ago, I was able to comfort her and hold her hand when she took her last breath",
  " I am changed",
  " I wish I could say that my life in sobriety is unicorns, rainbows, and that everyday is a ticker tape parade so I could inspire the newcomer to persevere but it isn&#8217;t and I&#8217;m frequently disappointed by that",
  " Especially when I compare myself to everyone else and make up great stories about how much better you are than me",
  " I expected that by now surely I&#8217;d be better &#8211; as in all better &#8211; but better isn&#8217;t a destination",
  "  I&#8217;m better than I was yesterday and the day before that",
  " AA has given me the tools to do things differently, if I choose to use them",
  " What I&#8217;m working on now in my recovery is self acceptance and trying to live in the middle &#8211; not better or worse",
  " I&#8217;m trying to stop setting goals, achieving them, discounting that success, and raising the bar yet again so that I can stay &#8220;less than",
  "&#8221; I am trying to learn about &#8220;enough",
  "&#8221; I&#8217;m trying to let go of being sad when another layer of the onion is peeled back, my character defects or boomerangs as I like to call them, keep coming back, and I judge myself for how recovered I SHOULD be by now",
  " Maybe someday I&#8217;ll be able to say that I have a life I never imagined like many of you do but I know that as long as I remain sober and work in recovery I have a chance",
  " Recovery isn&#8217;t for sissies, but it&#8217;s worth it",

  "I met Fernandez at a friend\u2019s party when I was twenty",
  "  I was a late bloomer and had never dated before",
  "  I had spent more time on academic pursuits than boys during my teenage years",
  "  So, when Fernandez wanted to be my boyfriend, I agreed",
  "  I even accepted his \u2018macho\u2019 attitude as a sign of maturity due to our five-year age gap",
  "  Fernandez and I were complete opposites in terms of personality",
  "  He was the social butterfly and I on the other hand preferred meaningful conversations over small talk",
  "  Yet, we decided to get married after a four-year courtship",
  "Days before the wedding, Fernandez told my mum that he lost a lot of money in a business deal",
  "  My mum had to bear the full cost of the wedding till he could pay her back",
  "  Although Fernandez promised to return the money, I found out later that, that was never his intention",
  " I wish someone had stopped me from marrying him then",
  "  At least, life would have been different for me",
  "Within the first week of my marriage, I started having doubts about Fernandez when he spent nights away from home",
  "  But he brushed them aside and told me I was overreacting",
  "  He claimed he was with his friends and had lost track of time",
  "  I grew up in a traditional family and was taught not to air my laundry in public, so I kept everything to myself",
  "  Hoping for a better future, I single-handedly serviced the mortgage loan for our home",
  " I held two jobs to make ends meet even when I was pregnant",
  "  But my efforts were invisible to Fernandez",
  " It seemed whatever I did was never enough for him",
  " He blamed me for everything that went wrong and played the \u2018tragic victim\u2019 in front of others",
  " His friends placed him on a pedestal thinking he was a righteous man while I was the incompetent wife",
  " Even though I was a beautiful person inside and out, his manipulation affected my self-esteem and confidence",
  " I started isolating myself from family and friends",
  " They thought I was just being my usual self, the \u2018anti-social\u2019 person; a common misconception about introverts",
  " Therefore, the change in me wasn&#8217;t obvious to them",
  "  Without anyone to confide in, I suffered in silence for many years",
  "  My coping strategy was to detach myself from emotions and instead focus on my career goals",
  "  I achieved much but always prioritized his needs just to keep the peace",
  "  Many a times, when the kids didn\u2019t complete their school homework or had forgotten to pack their books, Fernandez would blame me for being a lousy mother who only cared about my job",
  "  I swallowed my pride and apologized even though it wasn\u2019t my fault",
  "  Even then, Fernandez continued being a self-serving and manipulative evil jerk with no soul or compassion",
  " He treated me like a money-making machine and spent all his earnings on booze and entertainment",
  "One day, I caught Fernandez initiating sex with my domestic helper",
  " After much digging, the Pandora\u2019s box was unearthed",
  "  I found out that Fernandez had affairs with women ranging from mutual friends, domestic helpers to bar hostesses",
  " I felt disgusted that despite having so many flings, he still had sex with me regularly",
  " I gathered the evidence and considered my options very carefully",
  "  Then I confronted Fernandez, hoping he would come clean",
  "  I was even willing to start over again",
  "  However, Fernandez denied everything and smashed the evidence I had into pieces",
  "  That was my breaking point and something in me snapped",
  "  I picked up my left-over dignity and calmly told him I wanted a divorce",
  "  Fernandez did not believe me at first",
  "  He thought that I would never leave him and had taken me for granted",
  " However, I told Fernandez that I meant it and he became aggressive and blamed me for the breakdown of the marriage",
  "  His anger got uncontrollable that I had to call the police",
  "The divorce proceedings lasted three years as he fought for equal division of the matrimonial assets",
  "  But, he lost the case and I finally gained freedom from twenty-one years of soul crushing abuse",
  " Counselling helped me understand that sometimes life doesn\u2019t turn out the way we want it to be",
  " We make mistakes but we must learn to move on",
  " I still wonder where I had gone wrong",
  " Then, I tell myself that a creep like him will never change and it wasn\u2019t my fault",
  " It was time to let go of the past and heal",
  "  My teenage son asked me one day, \u201cMummy, do you think we will be happy when we find out how much you suffered",
  " Just to keep the family together",
  " You don\u2019t deserve this and you know that\u201d",
  "  And that statement was my hope for a better future without Fernandez",
  " Fernandez now lives in a rented room",
  " He has to work for a living and his senior years will be spent in isolation without savings",
  " He is no longer a good catch at the age of fifty",
  "  I believe that the law of Karma is fair and we will reap what we sow",

  " My father was a soldier on active duty, so he was gone most days of the year",
  " My mom had to do the heavy-lifting when it came to raising us, and she tried her hardest to keep us happy",
  " I considered us middle-class, but your idea and my idea of middle-class may differ",

  " By the time I was 11, puberty was working its magic and changing my body in ways I was still trying to understand",
  " I was in a very vulnerable state",
  "Unfortunately, a frequent visitor to the house took advantage of that vulnerability",
  " He would approach me to \u201ctalk,\u201d but talking always led to him reaching down my shirt or in my pants",

  " That loss of innocence before I could really understand what was happening broke me",
  " I began to hate myself",
  "Home wasn\u2019t the only place I experienced unwanted affections",
  " I couldn\u2019t walk down the street without a man pausing to stare at my budding breasts or newly developed curves",
  " Men the same age as my father used to approach me with a smug look on their face, as if their flirting with me was somehow a compliment",
  " I was an object to them; a new lunch special on the menu",

  " I hated myself and my body",
  " It felt like it was working against me",
  " I thought that if I didn\u2019t look like myself, guys wouldn\u2019t be trying to molest me",
  " I thought it was all my fault, and I fell into a deep depression",
  "At the young, impressionable age of 13, I attempted suicide",
  " Thankfully, I was not successful, but my family scolded me and insisted I never try something like that again",
  " So, I sat within my misery, hating myself in every way as I tried to traverse the hormonal minefield that is being a teenager",
  "As I got older, school fees became pricier and even harder to handle on my mom\u2019s minimal budget",
  " At 14, I started working any job I could find to help cover the costs",
  " In the following years, I tried to stay away from people",
  " When I wasn\u2019t in school or working, I was curled up by myself somewhere with a good book to keep me occupied",
  " Those books are what kept me sane",

  "\u201d To my dismay, graduation came at a time when a financial crisis was hitting Kenya, making jobs, food, and housing scarce",

  " Left behind me was all my trauma in Kenya",
  " I had a chance at a new beginning",
  "Coming to South Sudan, I had no idea what I was going to do for money, but I was determined to find something",
  " I stumbled across an ad for a beauty pageant and thought back to all the times I\u2019d been told I could be a model",

  " I watched as girls my age strutted across the stage, confidence emanating from their pores",
  " They carried themselves with a power I\u2019d never seen before",
  " They walked without fear of judgement, and it was refreshing",
  " It gave me the courage to walk like that too",
  "I wound up winning runner-up, and I was completely baffled",
  " I stood on stage surrounded by thunderous applause and smiling faces",
  " Backstage, fellow contestants congratulated me and bombarded me with genuine compliments",
  " I was told all the things I\u2019d wish I heard growing up",
  " That\u2019s when I came to a realization",

  " I shouldn\u2019t have let those who objectify my body control the narrative of my life",
  " I hold that power",
  " I decided to let how others viewed me empower me instead",
  "Competing in beauty pageants gave me a confidence I\u2019d never felt before, and each time I walked onto the stage, I knew in my heart that I had found my path",
  " After many more competitions, I finally won first place",
  " The winner of each pageant got money to fund a project of their choosing",
  " I knew exactly what I wanted to do",
  " I wanted to help little girls who were like me",
  " I wanted to help them feel empowered and know they\u2019re not alone",
  " I wanted them in a world still drowning in misogyny to love themselves and not feel inferior",
  "To do this, I started arranging appearances in local schools where I could give talks to the youth and help break the terrible cycle",
  " In many African countries, mental health and reporting sexual assault are not talked about and are most certainly not a priority",
  " I wanted to change that",
  " I started by simply telling little girls my story and what I\u2019d gone through",
  " I hope by sharing my trauma, it will keep other girls from facing the same trauma and suffering in silence",
  " Speaking my truth has helped me come to heal myself, and I think I\u2019m really getting through to the kids I talk to",
  " When I look back on the trauma I endured and all the self-hatred I felt growing up, I wish I could go back and help my younger self, but one cannot change the past, nor can they remain in the past for too long",
  " Doing so keeps you from moving forward into a better future",

  "so i always had a very happy normal life until 8th grade that was the time when everything changed and got messed up and it made me feel sad and insecure about things to be honest i was depressed and i felt like i had no one to talk to so let me tell you what happened in the country i live at women cant talk to men cause they are &#8216;whores&#8221; girls cant wear what ever they want cause they are called bitches women cant go where ever they want because they are called hoes so not sure if all of you are going to be able to understand this but somehow i was considered  like that for doing nothing literally nothing at all and did i mention that my parents worked at very important and known institutions and the country i live at is very small so all my parents thought about was &#8216;reputation&#8221; and then she found out about what happened (nothing actually happened people just played them because they knew that they had reputation) so my mom beats me and decides to cut my hair (we will get to the hair part) and i wore braids at school for the first time some very very short braids that really took 5 minutes to make both and time goes by and i somehow get traumatized by my oiwn mom and literally would start acting weird and suspicious in front of her for no reason because i never felt good enough for her and every day every single day she would accuse me for hiding something from her like i did something again ughh and than two months later it was my birthday i remember i got 25 dollars as a gift and that was all i felt like what i needed wasnt money it was something much more than that i needed trust and love by my own family especially my mom and did i mention that that gift wasnt from my parents or siblings that worked and had a salary and didnt think to bu me not even a small thing but anyway i remember me and the girls went upstairs at my sisters room they were doing their make up and taking pictures and you know girls things i mean after all they could they were pretty photogenic good bodies good teeth good phones and clothes and then i looked at me a girl that was wearing a small adidas sweater black jeans and a very tight bun that made my face look cringe and then time goes by and things change my mom looks me different and i straighten my hair and they look like a barbies hair for real and next year i would go at n9th grade i thought with myself things would change",

  "This story originally appeared in Kate Rademacher&#8217;s collaborative blog series on the topic of Risky Love: https://www",
  "katerademacher",
  "com/edge-of-faith-blogWithout giving it too much thought, I signed up to spend spring break my freshman year of college volunteering at Belle Reve, a New Orleans home for people living with AIDS",
  " It was 1998",
  " When I saw the flyer for my university\u2019s spring break service trips, I was initially enticed by the promise of only having to pay $50 to spend a week in New Orleans",
  " But I was also drawn to being with people whose lives were different from mine, particularly those who seemed to have been written off by society",
  " I suspected we all had more in common than the world had us believe",
  " Upon my arrival at Belle Reve, though, I second-guessed myself",
  " I had come with several other students, and on our first day, each of us was assigned a different task",
  " The house manager pointed me down a dark hallway and instructed me to knock on people\u2019s doors to see if they wanted company",
  " I was very shy and scared to disturb people",
  " Who was I to disrupt their peace",
  " Should I even be there",
  " As I stood frozen in the shadows, I recalled holding my mom\u2019s hand in the hallway of the Mother Theresa nursing home, where she regularly volunteered",
  " I remembered the pungent odor of medicine and cleaning powder, the echoing clack of walkers and canes, the vibrant sunlight filtering through the curtains and pooling on the green tile floor",
  " With my little sister and I in tow, my mom would walk from room to room, knocking on doors to see who felt like visiting",
  " If people didn\u2019t want a visit, they simply wouldn\u2019t answer",
  " And if they had been longing for company, their delight at the sight of us was infectious",
  " I couldn\u2019t have been more than five years old, yet I remember the residents clearly",
  " The 89-year old identical twin sisters whose white curls bobbed as they bickered and competed for our attention",
  " Johnny, the impish 90-year old man who wore sweater vests and cracked jokes and always invited us into his room to play cards",
  " When my mom wasn\u2019t looking, he\u2019d slip me cough drops as if they were candy",
  " We had no relatives there",
  " But my mom volunteered through our church to drive elderly people on their errands",
  " Since my sister and I were not yet in school, we were always along for the ride",
  " One day a woman asked my mom to take her to the nursing home to visit a friend",
  " While there, my mom saw the joy and energy that the presence of small children infused into the place, and she began to bring us regularly",
  " Thinking of her, I took a deep breath and began knocking",
  " The first person to answer his door was Chris, a lifelong musician",
  " A budding guitar player myself, I was relieved that we had something in common",
  " We strolled out to the shaded back porch of the pastel Louisiana house, and Chris strummed Neil Young\u2019s \u201cAfter the Gold Rush\u201d on his guitar, altering the lyrics to say, \u201cI was thinking about what a friend had said",
  " I was hoping he was alive",
  "\u201d I wondered who was on his mind as he sang that line",
  " Thinking back, I wish I had asked him",
  "While I was there, I played with two sweet children who lived at the house with their young, soft-spoken mother JoAnne",
  " I went to the park with James, a painter who was losing his eyesight",
  " He wove me a flower crown and laughed with delight when I refused to take it off",
  " I turned 19 that week",
  " The staff and residents of Belle Reve baked me a strawberry cake and sang to me loudly, their joyful chorus rising above the kaposi\u2019s sarcoma, the wasting syndrome, the stigma, the unknown",
  " I stopped wondering whether I belonged there",
  " Upon my return to Chicago, I signed up to volunteer at Bonaventure House, a Boystown residence for people living with AIDS",
  " I went there every Thursday night for the next three years",
  " The people who lived there were from all walks of life",
  " There were cis men and women and trans women and drag queens",
  " There were young and elderly people",
  " Straight and gay people",
  " Black and Latinx and Asian and white people",
  " People who grew up wealthy and people who grew up poor",
  " People who were brought up in the city and people who were raised on farms",
  " People who were battling addiction and people who were struggling to swallow dozens of pills a day to keep the virus at bay",
  " People who were on their deathbeds, and people who would live into old age",
  " People whose ashes would be scattered into Lake Michigan and people who would flee the house and discover the depth of their rock bottom",
  " People who would leave to get married and begin jobs and reunite with their families and people who would just disappear",
  " Every time someone died, there would be a memorial for the residents and volunteers to attend",
  " We\u2019d stand in the street and release red balloons into the gray Chicago sky",
  " Some ceremonies were bittersweet",
  " Richard was a middle-aged gay man who had lost nearly every friend he had to the epidemic in the 1980s",
  " I sensed that death released him from physical suffering into a joyful reunion with the loves of his life",
  " But for others, there was no sweetness in death",
  " I remember Calvin\u2019s anguish as he lay dying in the now-defunct Michael Reese hospital in Bronzeville in 1999",
  " A pair of rats ran across my feet and into the leaves as I walked up to the hospital entrance that fall night",
  " It was not a comforting place",
  " Calvin was my age",
  " He was infected by a childhood blood transfusion in the early 1980s",
  " He never had a normal life",
  " He would not live to see 21",
  " And he was angry",
  " Why him",
  " He poured his rage out to me, and what could I say",
  " What words could possibly ease his pain",
  " All I could do was look him in the eye, one kid holding the gaze of another",
  " One kid holding the hand of another",
  " One kid praying for the other to find peace",
  " Kissing him goodbye",
  " Sobbing on the bus ride home as strangers pretended not to see",
  " By the end of the week, Calvin was gone",
  " What does it do to you to attend memorial after memorial when you\u2019re 19, 20, 21 years old, between study sessions at the library and work shifts at the athletic office and parties and classes and basketball games and dates",
  " I felt that I was straddling two worlds, that the divide could tear me in half if I wasn\u2019t careful",
  " I grew discouraged by what I bore witness to each week: the physical suffering inflicted by opportunistic infections and side effects, the emotional toll of discrimination and isolation, and the constant presence of death",
  " I felt powerless and angry and fought waves of resentment for my seemingly carefree peers",
  " People were suffering, and far too few seemed concerned",
  " For awhile, rage fueled my advocacy",
  " I helped coordinate an on-campus display of the Names Project AIDS Quilt each year, and I wanted to scream, \u201cLook at this",
  " Look at all that\u2019s been lost",
  " LOOK",
  "\u201d But over time, as I grew closer with the residents of Bonaventure House, I relaxed",
  " Love began to overwhelm my anger",
  " My burning desire to change the world melted into a realization that I only needed to open myself up to transformation",
  " For as much injustice as existed in the world, there was always more love",
  " And the love was mine to have and experience if I was willing to embrace heartbreak",
  " I embraced heartbreak and found myself surrounded by teachers, mentors, and friends who had come face to face with death, a reckoning that altered them in beautiful and mysterious ways",
  " I felt God\u2019s presence in those who had been stripped of material, physical, and social wealth and distilled down to their essence",
  " In them I sensed an otherworldly transcendence",
  " The music to which their hearts beat seemed out of my range",
  " But I tried to march along, and eventually I fell in step",
  " Week after week, I practiced showing up to the possibility that another friend had taken a turn for the worse",
  " I practiced accepting what was and what would never be",
  " I practiced finding joy where it is easier to spot despair",
  " I practiced loving, and I practiced letting go",
  " I\u2019m still Facebook friends with one of the people I knew from the house",
  " He was a local musician, and we realized when we ran into each other at a show one night that we had mutual friends in the industry",
  " He\u2019s married with kids now, living out of state",
  " Many of the others are gone in the physical sense",
  " But I feel them sometimes, like guardian angels dancing in the periphery of my vision",
  " They helped shape me",
  " They are woven into my DNA",
  " That\u2019s the thing about letting people into your heart",
  " Once you love them, you never fully let them go",

  " It&#8217;s a story about friendship, love, addictions, bad choices, regret, self-hate, guilt, shame, grief and loss",
  " This is the story that changed my life, and I still struggle every single day because of it&#8230;I met Dwayne when I was 16",
  " Instantly I felt it, he was meant to be my best friend",
  " My soul-mate",
  " Not the romantic, &#8220;lets get married&#8221;, fall in love kind of soul-mate",
  " This was the &#8220;need you in my life&#8221;, lift you up, tell any and everything to, no judgement or fear, one and ONLY, irreplaceable friendship kind of soul-mate",
  " Right away he just got me",
  " It was like we already knew exactly who each other was",
  " I know everyone probably has someone like that at some point in life (I would hope), but nobody could possibly have, or will ever have anybody like him",
  " I did",
  " And then I didn&#8217;t&#8230;Eight years ago, I was struggling with addictions",
  " Dwayne and I were supporting each other in sobriety",
  " It was just a little over three weeks we had spent drug free, and we were distracting ourselves with other things to keep us on the right path",
  " Activities like swimming, bon fires with friends, long pointless car rides together",
  " One night, there was a bon fire, friends, laughter, music and joy",
  " I had been smoking pot that night (it helped control the other urges), and Dwayne and three others of us were all having drinks",
  " I politely rejected alcohol all night",
  " After a few hours I caved in and made myself ONE small drink of whiskey and coca-cola",
  " We decided to go out a bit after that to go swimming somewhere",
  " I remember leaving the house with Dwayne (who was driving), my boyfriend at the time, my other best friend and my little sister (she was 16, I was 18)",
  " Then it all just goes black",
  " I remember feeling like I just woke up, standing in the middle of a road, in the middle of the night",
  " All I was thinking about so far was why the hell we weren&#8217;t at the lake where we were originally headed",
  " There was a man I had never seen before standing near me saying &#8220;you need to sit down, I can see your skull&#8221;",
  " I remember only worrying about my little sister after that",
  " It was my job to keep her out of trouble",
  " My RESPONSIBILITY to keep her SAFE",
  " She was fine",
  " My boyfriend was fine",
  " My other friend had a fractured cheek bone, which first showed as the biggest, blackest shiner I have ever seen",
  " But she was alive, she was okay&#8230; then I heard that stranger man saying &#8220;can you hear me buddy",
  " Can you move anything&#8221;",
  " He was stuck in the back seat of that little 2 door bronco he owned, and the vehicle was front end down in a steep ditch, resting on a culvert",
  " What I remember after that are just pieces of a puzzle ive never been able to solve",
  " I can&#8217;t recall anything leading up to this accident, nor can I explain how it happened",
  " All I can tell you is that at some point, I got into the drivers seat (with no drivers license whatsoever)",
  " I was informed after a 6 month investigation by detectives (and multiple stories from my ex), that I had switched spots with Dwayne and had tried to make a very wide u-turn on a 2 lane highway",
  " I ran out of road and hit the ditch",
  " The impact of hitting the culvert would have sent my friend flying through the windshield; however, Dwayne broke both of his wrists by putting his arms out in front of her, which saved her life",
  " It&#8217;s also the reason he died that day",
  " The motion of him inserting himself in front of her, broke his neck",
  " I never saw him after the accident, I dont remember much of anything else either",
  " When I recieved his medical records, I read that he was air lifted to a bigger city&#8217;s hospital",
  " Just in that roughly twenty minute helicopter ride, he arrested three times",
  " And several times more upon arriving",
  " The estimated time of the accident was around 1:00am",
  " Dwayne died at 8:30 that same morning",
  "I was the reason",
  "\u00a0Almost two months later, I got news I was pregnant for the first time",
  " I was a mess, but the decision to keep my baby-my son, is what saved my life in those moments",
  " It was a total of six months after the car accident that I was arrested and charged with the death of my person, my soul-mate",
  " I waited for my punishment, went to court dates and stayed out of trouble",
  " I gave birth to my son ten months after the accident",
  " Three months after that, I was pregnant with my second (my daughter)",
  " I had a newborn baby, a toxic relationship, and a prison sentence coming",
  " How could I raise a second child, when I was immobilized by the thought of leaving the child I had just had",
  "",
  " I made three different appointments to abort my second pregnancy, none of which I kept",
  " It was a total of one year and five months after the accident that I finally received a two year sentence to serve in the only women&#8217;s federal institution in the province",
  " I left my eight month old son with my father, and left at five months pregnant with my daughter",
  " I gave birth to her five months later",
  " My dad and my son came and were able to stay with me for 72-hours after delivering her in a private visiting house at the institution",
  " We were able to do that once a month until I was released on day parole",
  "\u200e \u00a0I spent ten months in that jail, and another six months at a halfway house",
  " I missed my son&#8217;s firsts&#8217;",
  " First christmas, birthday, words, steps",
  "",
  " and I missed the first eight months of my daughters life",
  "",
  " I live with this white-hot pain throughout my entire body, every day, all day",
  " The guilt of causing my best friends death is enough to make me want to disappear even after eight years",
  " And all of the things I missed, the things I had to give up: the lullabies I didn&#8217;t sing my babies to sleep to, the hugs and kisses, the smiles and laughter",
  " Sometimes I feel that it was selfish of me to bring those two perfect children, into this world, knowing that I would be leaving them without their mother, the one person who is always supposed to be there for them right from the beginning until the very end",
  " I gave them life, because I wanted desperately for someone to believe in me and love me unconditionally (the way Dwayne did) and as I sit and write this right now, nobody has ever made me feel that whole and worthy since he&#8217;s been gone",
  "\u00a0After I came home, I graduated highschool, got a job and started college",
  " Things were pretty good considering what I had just came out of",
  " That is until college got harder with two toddlers not even in school yet",
  " The pressure of being this accomplished, mature woman began weighing down on me heavier each day",
  " Constantly feeling the need to prove that I was not just some loser out of prison who had failed in life by the age of 22",
  " The anxiety I felt from that spiraled me back into addiction",
  " I dropped out of college with less than a year left of the program",
  " I started using again, and I got a really shitty boyfriend",
  " I got so deep into that depression and feeling like a failure, (especially even more after becoming a college drop out), that I couldn&#8217;t stand feeling like a constant disappointment everyday to my kids and my dad any longer",
  " So I made what has been THE worst decision out of them all, and I moved in with my boyfriend, leaving my children to stay with my dad",
  " I couldn&#8217;t control the desire to get high and forget the person I was",
  " I just wanted to be someone else, anyone else, even just for a minute each time",
  " I couldn&#8217;t get up in the mornings and be anywhere close to the mother my kids deserved, and just looking at their faces made me die inside picturing all the things they had to do/go through without me there beside them; yet how they had become these absolutely amazing little humans&#8230; even without me",
  " I honestly believed they would be safer, healthier and happier staying with my dad in the only home they&#8217;ve known",
  " I still stand by that decision as much as I hate myself for leaving them a second time and BY CHOICE",
  " Only because I think about dragging them along with me, down deeper into my disastrous spiral of self loathing, and what kind of life that would be for them",
  " I left",
  " I was literally 5 minutes down the street (extrememly small town)",
  " I called almost everyday, when I wasn&#8217;t too messed up to talk to my dad without sounding like a what most people would call a train wreck",
  "",
  " I call it a hot-mess express",
  " I saw them all the time, and only sober",
  " That lasted an entire year",
  " Drugs, people, crowds, drugs, drinking, purging, bulimia, drugs, repeat",
  " I finally got the nerve to take off one day while my bf was at work",
  " He was angry, he yelled and cursed me",
  " The next morning I went home and found a complete stranger lying next to him in our bed",
  " I quietly gatherted what I could find and left without a word",
  " It&#8217;s been just over 16 months since that day",
  " I have an incredible boyfriend who doesn&#8217;t scream at me, try to control me, or put me down",
  " I&#8217;m still easing back into being a full-time mom again, and my babies are still living with my dad",
  " I still feel guilt, that I don&#8217;t think will ever go away as a parent, a mother",
  " I&#8217;m non-stop house hunting to find a home for us to start our lives in together",
  " Everything is slowly coming together I hope",
  " Im going to struggle as an addict my entire life, so I have attended meetings and stayed sober",
  " Well, I don&#8217;t strongly think that very manmany people can relate to this jumble of issues, but I&#8217;m sure a lot of them can take whatever piece that they understand and gain something/anything from taking a glance at my life",
  " I&#8217;m not a horrible person",
  " I am shy and kind and thoughtful",
  " I always prefer &#8220;the little things&#8221; and giving/recieving uplifting compliments to all around me",
  " I have made more mistakes than most at my age (26) but I have been all through hell, hit rock-bottom, and came back standing tall after it all",

  " This dark cloud stuck with me throughout primary school to High school",
  " In high school,I had a major problem with socialising and just making friends",
  " I also had a lot of questions about my self-image,I&#8217;d as far as comparing myself to others and asking God why he&#8217;d made me like this and why not like the person I was comparing myself to",

  "On November 18, 2019, I attempted to kill myself I was in a very dark headspace where I felt as if I wasn\u2019t good enough, that nobody loved or cared about me",
  " The night before (November 17, 2020) it hit midnight I had got out of the shower and got dressed, I sat in my bed and out of nowhere I started having an anxiety attack and I was used to having the attacks but It was months since I had got one so it took me by surprise and I usually don\u2019t do anything to help it go away I just let it happens they usually only last 10-15 mins but that day it went on for at least an hour or more it was so long I lost track of time",
  " So in having the attack For so long and being in a dark place at the same time&#8230; I decided to help myself to make everything stop make everything go away at that moment I didn\u2019t want to feel anything I felt numb to everything",
  " First I started off with just cutting my arms as a way of having control of the pain as I would usually do but it wasn\u2019t helping so I did something else",
  " I got up from my bed went to the kitchen opened the cabinet where my mom keeps all of the pills in and I grabbed a bottle of **** and a pack of ****",
  " The bottle was filled up to the top and the pack was new it only had 6 pills inside",
  " I took 25 pills of **** and 5 of ****",
  " From that moment I realized that there was nothing I wanted more than to pretty much die just end everything",
  " As soon as I took the pills I started to feel tired and my eyes felt heavy I didn\u2019t even notice when I fell asleep, but the moment I woke up the first thing my body did was try and help me by making me throw up all the pills I took",
  " It was like 4:30 in the morning and I was in my room throwing up all the pills I took",
  " After I stopped I went back to sleep just too wake up at least 30mins later to throw up again",
  " After that o completely stopped throwing up only to wake up in the morning sweating, pain in my chest not being able to breathe or talk",
  " Foaming out the mouth trying to wake my little sister up so she could get help as soon as she woke up I managed to get the word out to say \u201dM I\u2019m dying go get help\u201d she gets up and runs to get my mom, my mom runs to my room to find me face down in my bed crying in pain and to see the pill bottle on the floor",
  " She calls an ambulance and try\u2019s to help me throw it all up but nothing was working the ambulance gets to the house and tries to help me up to get me in a wheelchair to take me to the hospital",
  " Once I got to the hospital the put me an I",

  " You were allowed visitors but family only and you were allowed to wear your own clothes but still being stuck in there felt like a prison, I felt more alone than I had ever felt in my life but in doing that it\u2019s been a big wake up call even though sometime I don\u2019t wanna be here anymore I just think of all the thing I would be missing out on, and the things life might have planned for me whether their good or bad",

  "  My coaches were very supportive and showed me that it did not matter what I looked like that I was worth something and that I could do anything that I wanted to do, my first 5k run I was concerned that I would not finish or that I would be laughed at , but that was not the case, My running buddy pushed me and told me that I had this , my coaches were waiting for me at the finish line as well as my family, it was one of the BEST feelings in the world to have people cheering for Me and that I DID IT",

  " This is what I have built my life, my goals, and my dreams upon",
  " From that point I worked even harder",

  " I visited the Academy Summer 2018 with my grandpa, a retired Air Force pilot, and my mom",
  " I\u2019ll never forget standing in the Academy\u2019s FamCamp under the Colorado stars, surrounded by the smell of the pines, and of course, the beautiful Academy, feeling more at peace than I ever had in my life",
  " I still curse this day because I can\u2019t understand why that feeling would betray me",
  " The next Summer I attended the Summer Seminar",
  " I was already in love with the Academy, but this trip made it even more clear that this was my future home",

  " With all of this said, I have eczema on the palms of my hands",
  " It had never affected me in a serious way",
  " If it hurt, I kept fighting",
  " If it bled, I put a bandaid on (sometimes), and I moved on",
  " This was tested when I played basketball",
  " I played year round from 7th until 11th grade",
  " Some games I had to wrap my hands so blood would not get on the ball",

  " I applied to both my senators and my congressman",
  " My senior year of high school began",

  " Why not challenge myself",
  " Why not get as much college credit as possible",
  " (Unfortunately, I negatively can answer these questions now)",
  " I had to balance a lot, but I had done this my entire life",

  " Through all this, I began getting responses from the senators and congressmen",
  " Luckily, I got an interview with all three",
  " I was beyond nervous for these interviews, and practiced quite a bit",
  " I prayed a lot going into them",
  " Slowly, the results reached me",
  " I got a nomination from all three sources",
  " I am fairly confident this doesn&#8217;t happen often, and it only made me confident in my future",
  " I guess I believe that God could not possibly send me all these signs, and make me successful, and then take it from me",
  " The application had a physical test that I asked my track coach to administer",
  " I trained so much for this because I knew the better I did, the more impressive it would look on my application",
  " After XC practice I would come home and do pull-ups, sit-ups, and push-ups",
  " I did countless reps",

  " Now, this is going to sound silly, but I also remember the worst day of my life",
  " Since then, it has spiraled down and down, and it feels like even God has been struggling to carry me on (and sometimes I have felt completely abandoned)",
  " I knew I would not be medically qualified, so I sent in a waiver request and some extra papers",
  " In hindsight, I have no idea why I thought that this would be enough, but ignorance is bliss",
  " I was walking into school and I checked my email",
  " I had gotten one from the Academy regarding my medical status",
  " I was so excited and nervous, but I have always been an optimist, and I figured God was fighting this for me",
  " Together, I was confident my waiver got accepted",
  " In first period I was able to open the letter",
  " You could probably guess what it said",
  " My waiver had been denied, but not only that, the letter made it seem like there was no chance of going on, or trying again",
  " I cried through my entire test in second period; my teacher and best friend were a little concerned",
  " I checked myself out after that and crie the entire way home",
  "So I had a setback",
  " An academy cadet would keep trying (and maybe they would have cried less",
  ") That\u2019s what I did",
  " I called the number in the letter and asked every question I could about how I could fix this",
  " Ultimately, it was not my decision whether this would be fixed, it was God and the government who was in control",

  "So that phone call did not go as planned",
  " I kept trying",
  " I called everyone I knew and everyone they knew that I thought could help",
  " I went to more doctors and tried to prove that I was fine",
  " I got multiple doctor recommendations that I am perfectly capable of serving",
  " I went to appointments, and I waited",
  " The lady on the other end of the phone was so tired of me and my hopeless calls",
  " This process took months, but there was nothing left I could do",
  " I remember one night when I asked so many saints to pray for me",
  " I stayed up for hours praying",
  " Somehow, I still believed it would work out",
  " I had my grandparents, family, and small group all praying for some miracle",
  " I held onto this hope",
  " XC season had ended, and I had my eyes open for track",
  " I planned on running the 800",
  " My dad is an amazing coach and he trained my best friend and I during the indoor season",
  " I had never worked so hard for something in my life (and I used to stay in the gym hours after practice)",
  " I wanted to run so badly in college",
  " I had some big goals, and if my USAFA goals failed, at least I could run",
  " I ran 5 indoor meets unattached",
  " It was wild",
  " I had never thrown up so much for something in my life",
  " The workouts we did hurt and they were paying off",
  " I felt 10x stronger than I did over the XC season",
  " It was a fun adventure",
  " The stress hit when school track started, and our school coaches ahd to get involved",
  " We stayed doing our own workouts as long as possible",
  " It was hard because they knew how hard we were working and they knew our PRs, but not once did they say \u201cgood job\u201d or \u201ccongrats",
  "\u201d Our head coach saw us running our butts off everyday, and he still yelled at us",
  " Later in the season he called me a \u201chalf-timer",
  "\u201d I had one coach tell me that I would never run in college unless I ran XC, because colleges take any female XC runners",
  " This entire time I was the fastest 800 runner and hurdler on the team",
  " I shouldn\u2019t let their words and actions bother me so much",
  " I had my times to speak for themselves",
  " So my best friend and I kept working towards our goals",
  " On February 28th, I was notified that I was not admitted into the academy",
  " I was not surprised, but I was heartbroken all over again",
  " The tears came again",
  " Some days it hits harder than others and I can\u2019t get out of bed or go to school",
  " How could it be that my dry hands are holding me back from my dream",
  " How could I excel so much in every category that I had control over, and fail so hard in the easiest one",
  " I still don\u2019t understand",
  " But I have to think of other colleges",
  " In the end, USAFA was my only chance to go to an \u201cexpensive\u201d college or to go out of state",
  " Unless I got the Type 1 AFROTC scholarship",
  " Getting the lowest scholarship hit hard too",
  " It was hard to accept that my best-my high test scores, my extracurriculars, my grades- were not enough",
  " I received a Type 7 scholarship, which I am very grateful for",
  " Throughout my life I only strive for the best, so I was humbled big time",
  " The day before the scholarship results came out I told my best friend that the worst thing that could happen was that I got the lowest scholarship",

  " No ROTC scholarship",
  " Fine, I\u2019ll find a new way",
  " I still have running",
  " I let myself daydream (when I wasn\u2019t studying or running) about this",

  " Maybe my hard work would pay off in some way",
  " I felt like with almost everything that had been taken, I could ask for at least a chance with running",
  " I am so passionate about it that part of me still believes if I do not have the opportunity to sign with a school, I can walk on",
  " There were two D2 schools I was talking to",
  " However, they were out of state and way too expensive even with scholarships",
  " So I keep working",

  " Truly, I have never worked so hard in my life",
  " When I broke 2:30 I was in the wrong heat",
  " I was more than 50 meter in front of everyone",
  " All I want is the chance to race girls who run sub 2:25",
  " I was so excited to finally have a PR that would seed me closer to them",

  " I have given up a lot to focus on this",

  " What if I ran my last track meet without knowing it",
  "The virus has also hit my schooling pretty hard",
  " At first, I was worried about learning all the material before AP exams (remember how I took 5 AP classes specifically for college credit)",
  " Fortunately, the college board has changed requirements, but I fear the repercussions of this",
  " I fear that all the work I have put in the past two semesters would not have been worth it",

  "     The title of the story is pretty straightforward and it is meant to be taken literally",
  " Word for word, because that&#8217;s my reality and has been for over a decade",
  " Finally, at the hour of 4:30AM on March 19th, 2020 I&#8217;d like to share something with the entire world that I have kept to myself for over a decade now",
  " Considering all the mayhem taking place on this wonderful planet due to lack of peace, spirituality,  and wisdom there may not be another better opportunity to pour out what has been occupied and a part of my life for so many years",
  "  I&#8217;m sure you are all wondering why the heck would anybody do such an absurd and downright outrageous task",
  " Well, after 10 years here it goes: It all started with my mother telling me a story of how I was an &#8220;accident baby,&#8221; and how they tried to perform a clinical abortion which somehow failed (mind you, this was in the early 90&#8217;s)",
  " As a child around the age of 4-5 years, this was very shocking, nor did I have a clue nor proper guidance to understand it better",
  " Somehow I managed to put that in the back of my mind and decided to become a studious child",
  " That didn&#8217;t go too well",
  " Why",
  " Because everyday and every time I saw myself in the mirror or in a reflection, my disgust with the way my ears would flare out on the side of my head resembling the Disney movie&#8217;s character Dumbo just grew day by day",
  " For those who are not aware, Dumbo is a flying elephant with these very big ears and is rather adorable",
  " The elephant character might have been adorable to many, but &#8220;Dumbo&#8221; became a nickname for me at school and that&#8217;s when the severe bullying happened, which was far from adorable",
  " That left many scars- emotional scars that would and still haunt me till this very day, clearly",
  " Years and years passed of being bullied severely to the point where it escalated to the point that I decided to take a stand up for myself",
  " At the age of 12, scarred with years of bullying, completely disgusted with personal appearance, having very low self-esteem as well as self-confidence, I decided to finally stand up for myself against the bullies",
  " It was 8th grade, recess time, everyone mingling in their groups, sharing laughs and foods whilst the young 12 year old me walked alongside my shadow organizing my binder that I had so much pride in due to the fact that I had no friends at all",
  " School, books, my binder, and writing utensils were my only friends",
  " Anyways, as I was organizing my binder my favorite bully came up to me, took out all of the papers from my binder and threw them in mid air just as how graduates toss their hats out of a celebratory tradition",
  " Oh, while he was throwing my hardwork in the air like worthless pieces of trash, he made sure to call all sorts of names(Dumbo, ugly, loser etc",
  ") Little did anyone know that I had had enough and decided to make a stand for myself the day prior when I found a hand knife on the curb",
  " I told myself that I&#8217;d finally take a stand for myself after all these years; and I did",
  " Well, the next day I  got myself expelled by drawing my knife on the kid from because i couldn&#8217;t take it anymore",
  " I was done with the flawed school system, abuse and lack of understanding at home, the bullying, and most of all- the way I looked",
  "   It was started after that",
  " After getting expelled from school, I thought of ways to pin my ears back since they were the main reason of me being bullied",
  " For hours, I searched my entire house finally ending up with a Super-glue stick in my hand and a crazy idea that would change my entire life and body",
  "  By now, you guys probably have a clue of what&#8217;s to come next",
  " Yes, you guessed right",
  " I started to Super-glue my ears back and never wore my hair up without covering at least half of my ear(even after Supergluing them)",
  "  This went on even after I was sent to a boarding school, upon returning, throughout my teenage years, and shockingly into my adult years up to age 27",
  " Along the way, I always felt sick but pushed thru because I couldn&#8217;t handle one more person calling me &#8220;Dumbo&#8221; or talking down on my ears",
  " I wanted to look perfect, and I did for years",
  " No one at all suspected that I was doing this",
  " Once, I tried discussing it with my doctor whose answer was &#8220;just stop doing it, simple as that",
  "&#8221; For me, it was much more difficult than that",
  " My parents and family had no clue about this since I would sneak the glue sticks from drawers or purchase them with my allowance money",
  " On top of it all, this was just so insane that I knew I couldn&#8217;t tell anyone after seeing my doctor&#8217;s reaction",
  " For years and years I&#8217;ve been suffering silently, not knowing what to do",
  " Just being lost, feeling so insecure to the point I&#8217;ve started to lose my relationships with everyone, dreading life, and desperately seeking a way out of this",
  " After many hours of research on the net, I came across a solution called Otoplasty",
  " This has been on my wishlist for as long as I can remember now",
  " The only problem being that my parents hadn&#8217;t nor have clue that I Super-glue my ears, they cannot provide me with funds for it",
  " Besides that, this is a problem I brought upon myself purely due to lack of Self-confidence",
  " It had become an addiction and it still was until recently I started seeing lumps out of my arm and neck",
  " This has me so terrified that I have now decided to share with someone, because I&#8217;m truly scared for my life",
  " Going to the hospital is now my priority, but with the current pandemic going on it is a very risky task",
  " Therefore, hopefully sharing this with the world will provide me with help, support, and love",
  " Being bullied feels terrible",
  " It harms an individual&#8217;s ability to grow with confidence and the right kind of brain development, at least from personal standpoin",
  " This must be stopped because there are so many wonderful little children whose learning process gets halted and disturbed without their parents ever knowing why or what happened",
  "  Many children, including my young self are not comfortable or afraid to speak to someone else due to the fear of being judged, condemned, and further abused",
  " This is my story",
  " After almost 14 years of consistently Super-gluing my ears, I feel even more lonely, lost, and depressed with no solution and serious health problems",
  " Please, read this and speak to your kids, nieces, nephews, grandkids, neighbors to let them know that it&#8217;s okay to talk about their problems",
  " It&#8217;s okay to accept and be yourself",
  " I am currently in a very unfortunate position, which I know I have brought upon myself, but if I can change even one child&#8217;s life with this then I know this was the right thing to do instead of suffering in silence",
  " My prayers and warm wishes goes out to all the victims and their families of the Coronavirus pandemic",
  " May you all stay safe, happy, and filled with a warm heart",

  "A couple of years ago, thanks to social media, I was able to meet with a friend from my adolescence with whom I lost contact for the last three decades",
  " The happiness and curiosity were intense and as a part of the recap she asked me to summarize my life",
  "I was not sure how to begin since many things had happened throughout those years, so without giving it too much thought, I ended up summing it up with a mathematical equation:\u201cTwo countries, three marriages, two divorces and one beautiful daughter\u201d I said",
  "No doubt, my friend\u2019s response was full of surprise and disbelief because she knew me as a conservative and analytical person",
  " Our conversation made me evaluate the situations that marked the decisions linked to the most important areas in my life: where to live, who my partner would be and how I was going to live",
  "The mathematical count didn\u2019t look like a successful story, so I had to reflect on the reasons that made me summarize my life with those numbers",
  " The conclusion was revealing because I recognized that when I felt lonely and vulnerable, I made decisions based on my own weaknesses and mixed emotions",
  " Ironically, the same decisions that led me to the trial and error exercise also gave me the opportunity to strengthen other values like gratitude, tolerance, patience and especially self-esteem",
  "My first marriage was a complete failure for not knowing how to recognize the signs that life was giving me",
  " I pushed a toxic relationship where I wanted to be the decision maker and the savior of my partner at that time",
  " That first divorce was a beautiful release that let me regain my life and helped me understand that my biggest responsibility was to myself",
  "After feeling that my inner scars were healed and that I was able to cope with my past, I felt that I was ready to accept a marriage commitment for a second time",
  " This time my ability to function as a \u201cteam\u201d with my new partner was very limited",
  " I was also incapable of making deals regarding what I was able to accept or not within the relationship",
  " Unconsciously I lived in \u201cdefense\u201d mode, fully focused on what I needed and with a minimal tolerance for the others",
  " After a year of living together, I decided that I didn\u2019t want to continue with the marriage and asked my husband for the easiest solution that I knew: a friendly divorce without taking the time for adjustments and growth as a couple",
  "A short time later the second rupture turned into the bridge for a third relationship in my life",
  " This is how I chose to initiate what I knew was going to be a definitive project in my life",
  " My second husband was also my third (some people call me repeat offender)",
  " This time we made sure to have a clear and honest \u201cdeal\u201d for coexistence",

  "Hi, my name is Mi&#8217;Kaylah and I am a fourth grader",
  " I participate in GOTR",
  " GOTR has inspired me to be healthy, confident, and joyful",
  " First of all, GOTR has taught me to be healthy by eating healthy and not to much junk food",
  " I now know not to eat to much candy and junk food, but to eat more healthy foods",
  " I&#8217;ve learned that eating healthy can keep your body in good shape",
  " Next, GOTR has taught me to be confident by believing in myself and not putting to much pressure on myself",
  " My coaches have taught me to run or walk at my own pace, so I wont get tired to early",
  " Last of all, I have been inspired to be joyful",
  " When I go to GOTR, I&#8217;m excited because I am able to see and make friends",
  " Everyone is always smiling and having so much fun together",

  "Do you or someone you love suffer from depression",
  " If you&#8217;re female, you may experience the condition differently than your male peers",
  " Even though the disorder may feel the same on the inside, it may manifest in diverse ways",
  " Additionally, some treatments may work contrastingly in men and women",
  " There are physiological differences that impact how medications and other substances affect the body",
  " Understanding the unique ways females experience the disease can help improve your outcomes and get you feeling better sooner",
  " I know it&#8217;s helped me on my journey",
  "1",
  " Women Ruminate More Often Men tend to become irritable when they&#8217;re depressed because western society tells them to remain stoic",
  " Rather than manifest the typical tearfulness, they may strike out in anger or participate in high-risk activities like speeding",
  " Conversely, society permits women to express their emotions \u2014 which is probably why I grow tearful more often",
  "This dynamic may partially explain why women are twice as likely to receive a depression diagnosis than their male peers &#091;1&#093;",
  " Other factors include societal pressures, such as financial difficulties brought on by disparities in pay in the workplace",
  " 2",
  " Women May Become Addicted More Quickly Women who attempt to self-medicate with drugs or alcohol may fall prey to addiction more readily than their male peers",
  " Part of the reason for this phenomenon is biological",
  " Women have a lower percentage of water in the body, which means they have less to dilute alcohol when they drink it &#091;2&#093;",
  " Thus, they get intoxicated quicker",
  " Furthermore, women have less of a substance called alcohol dehydrogenase in their digestive systems, further enhancing the euphoric effects",
  " Women also tend to drink more to combat negative feelings, whereas men tend to do so to socialize",
  " I was a big one for this",
  " My after-work ritual always included wine",
  " As I quickly learned, drinking alone can sometimes spiral into addiction",
  " 3",
  " Women Attempt Suicide More Often, But Men SucceedYou would think the gender with higher rates of depression would die by suicide most often",
  " However, men commit suicide at 3",
  "5 times the rate of women in the U",
  "S",
  ", even though females attempt the act more often &#091;3&#093;",
  " I&#8217;ve had several close female friends try to end their lives",
  " However, why do men die more frequently by this method",
  " The answer often lies in the method",
  " Men are more likely to have access to firearms, and even when they don&#8217;t, they&#8217;re more likely to take violent measures like tossing themselves off a skyscraper or a bridge",
  " Firearms account for more than half of all suicides, so discussions of sensible gun policy should involve this statistic &#091;4&#093;",
  " 4",
  " Hormones Can Cause Roller Coasters in Females Another reason more women report depression than men may stem from hormonal factors",
  " When a woman enters puberty \u2014 and later, menopause \u2014 hormones flood her system, causing behavioral and mood changes",
  " Additionally, her hormonal levels fluctuate throughout the month",
  "Women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), for example, can experience severe depression before and during their menstrual cycles &#091;5&#093;",
  " Seeing their gynecologist for diagnosis may lead to a psychiatric referral for treatment",
  " Once a woman finishes childbearing, she might find relief from a partial hysterectomy",
  "5",
  " Antidepressants May Work Differently in FemalesWhile researchers haven&#8217;t reached a clear consensus on how antidepressants work differently in men and women, some studies have shown disparities",
  " For example, men tend to react more positively to the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine than women &#091;6&#093;",
  " Doctors also need to adjust dosages for the various body sizes and compositions between males and females",
  "The same drug that does wonders for your male significant other may not work as well for you",
  " My fianc\u00e9\u2019s antidepressants didn\u2019t work for me, for example",
  " We have both tried a variety of antidepressants, with incredibly different reactions between the two of us",
  " These differences highlight the essential nature of early intervention, as it can take time to find a regimen that works",
  " Understanding How Women Experience Depression Differently Helps You Find Treatment Once you understand how depression manifests in women and men, you can coordinate more effectively with your doctor on your treatment",
  " I can tell you that it helps",
  " I ignored my condition for a long time because it didn\u2019t feel like the most pressing issue in my life at the time \u2014 at least, not as pressing as, say, financial concerns or physical ailments",
  " But the reality is that it is so much more pressing than you may realize, and it builds on itself",
  " Especially as women, we have a higher tendency to explain away things, apologize a lot and minimize our pain",
  " Take it from me \u2014 please don\u2019t do this to yourself",
  " If you or someone you love suffers from this disease, take note \u2014 and take care of yourself",

  "GOTR has inspired me to stay positive",
  " Before GOTR I was a little negative",
  " I used to be nervous about cheering other people on, but GOTR has helped me by practicing positivity",
  " I liked it when we practiced turning something negative into something positive",
  " GOTR lets us give our opinions and ideas and takes them seriously which really boosted my confidence",
  " Sometimes its hard to cheer yourself up or know that you&#8217;re capable of doing things",
  " To help those times GOTR has taught girls and myself how to stay positive cheer each other on and be confident",
  " I activate my star power by pushing negative clouds in my heart away so I can see the pretty little star that belongs to me",
  " I do this by thinking about my good decisions I&#8217;ve made",
  " I review all those bad clouds and every time I finish that negative cloud thought I imagine it pops making my star brighter",
  " GOTR did so many things for me",
  " I learned things that would&#8217;ve been hard for me to learn on my own",
  " I learned how to do things right",

  "Trigger warning: Before reading this post, please be aware that it includes descriptions of childhood sexual abuse",
  "Okay so let\u2019s just get started, just a warning it\u2019s a very long story although we will be flashing through about 14 years of my life, so there might be some details that I miss",
  " I\u2019ll try to be as detailed as possible",
  " (For your understanding this is very nerve racking because I have to be very vulnerable",
  ") Okay so my mother has a boyfriend that she has been with since I was 2 years old so he basically raised me",
  " When I was 7 my mom left and we moved to Waterbury, Connecticut without him",
  " Eventually she let him back into our lives and that\u2019s when it started for me",
  " So my sisters used to make fun of me because I was going through a change in my life and my hygiene was terrible",
  " My mothers boyfriend offered to help me by showing me how to keep myself clean or so I thought",
  " It started that way at least and then it escalated to him having me in the back of the car with my pants down while he looked at my underwear",
  " There was a new sound that I was introduced  (I didn\u2019t find out what it was until later on in life) this happened for years and I never told anybody because he told me if I did child protective services would take me away from my mom and also that nobody would believe me",
  " I remember when he dropped me and my little brother off at school he would take us really early so he could drop my brother and then go and find parking around the block somewhere, where he would cover all the windows and have me pull down my pants to show him my underwear",
  " When I turned 12 I remember he told me to take a shower because he wanted to see what I do in the shower",
  " I remember being really uncomfortable because I was naked in the shower with my eyes closed because he told me to close my eyes while I washed my hair",
  " Later that year I told my mom what had been happening to me and she confronted him and he threw a fit throwing things around the kitchen",
  " That day he broke the microwave and my mothers coffee pot",
  " The yelling and screaming made me very scared but my mother stayed with him still",
  " After that he stopped whatever he was doing",
  " But when I turned 13 I started gaining weight and started being uncomfortable with my own body",
  " He pulled me aside and asked me if I wanted to loose the weight that I was gaining",
  " He told me that I should gain some mussels because what if one day girls tried to jump me in school (which never happened because I am a very quiet person and didn\u2019t even talk to many people)",
  " We started working out together and just like last time it started out okay but then escalated from there",
  " We started sneaking off and not telling my mother or anybody",
  " Now you may be asking yourself why did you go back after what happened last time and I would say I honestly thought it would be different and also he made me feel like I needed him in order to accomplish loosing weight and that I could never do it on my own and that stuck on me for a while",
  " I would say a good 3 to 4 years",
  " And through those years he had me lock my room door (which I shared with two of my sisters) and he\u2019d climb through the fire escape",
  " So I would have to wait for him and then do my workout which was working but it was weird because he had me do it in either tights or my underwear and once again the sound that haunted my childhood was back",
  " He is a very manipulative man and he knew what to say to get you to not say anything",
  " He told me not to tell anybody this time because he wanted people to compliment me",
  " And that sounded great to me and when it happened I felt amazing",
  " It felt like so what if you feel uncomfortable, sexualized, and embarrassed you\u2019re getting the results you wanted stop complaining and people are noticing the work you put in",
  " Also although he made me feel that way in that moment I still felt like I had to made him proud because he would compare me to my sisters whom he trained me to hate",
  " We had many conversations because he made me feel I couldn\u2019t talk to anybody else because they would never understand",
  " When I turned 16 I started telling my siblings everything and they encouraged me to tell my mother",
  " When I told her I had my little brother tell her with me because I didn\u2019t feel strong enough",
  " My mother dragged me and my brother to the police station and I made a report",
  " We then went to my aunts house where we spent the night and in the morning we told everybody what happened and there were a lot of tears because they didn\u2019t know, but how could they like I said he was a very manipulative man",
  " My mother kicked him out of the house and everything was fine",
  " Then one day I was walking to the bus to go to school and there he was I was terrified and he stopped and said \u201cListen I\u2019m not mad at you but I just wanted to let you know right now I\u2019m living out of my car so if you could just tell your mother that you made it all up that would be great",
  "\u201d (By the way I later found out he was not living out of his car he was living with his mother) Obviously I didn\u2019t tell my mother that because I wasn\u2019t lying",
  " But I did go home and tell my mother that he had stopped me and I was scared so from then on she walked me to the bus and stood there until the bus came",
  " That October my mother left and moved to South Carolina and took my little brother with her but I stood with my older siblings and only one of them actually took care of me",
  " Until I got tired of it because I wasn\u2019t eating because they told me not to touch anything in the fridge because it was for them and them only",
  " I had lost so much weight I hadn\u2019t weighed that much since I was 11 and I was 16 now so you can only imagine",
  " So I messaged my mom and she bought me a ticket to go to South Carolina",
  " I really enjoyed it was fun I got to spend a lot of time with my sister and my nieces and nephew",
  " We had to come back to New York because it was really hard to register me for school and I was missing a lot of school it was almost 2 months",
  " When we came back the plan was that I was going to sleep with my mother, but my mother had other plans after the first night",
  " She decided that I should take the cushions off the couch and sleep in my brothers room on the floor because she wanted to sleep with her boyfriend",
  " One day I got irritated because I couldn\u2019t sleep well but since my sister was gone most of the time my brother told me I should just sleep on her bed",
  " Then my sister walked in and asked why I was in her bed and I told her",
  " She didn\u2019t get mad at me but she dropped her stuff and went to the kitchen where my mother was and she just went off and started yelling at her coming to my defense",
  " I started crying because I felt ashamed that I was pushed to the side by my own mother",
  " In the next few months he slowly started to move back in until he came back completely and my little brother blamed himself because of it because he said he wanted to build a relationship with his dad and I didn\u2019t blame him because I knew how manipulative he can be because I would do the same thing and blame myself for the situation I was in",
  " When I turned 18 once again I got myself in the same situation as the second time because I was gaining weight and my self esteem was terrible",
  " He fed off of that and had me believing that I was unable to fix myself without his help",
  " I later realized that wasn\u2019t true",
  " Then I started going to church because it was a few hours away from my own personal hell",
  " And this time was different because he had expressed to me that he wanted to have sex with me in exchange for him buying me things",
  " I felt completely disgusting and I wanted to just kill myself so he couldn\u2019t have me",
  " Thankfully I was saved by god and I can say I feel like I can breathe and I am free and I am happy",
  " Although some days I find myself crying because I\u2019m so angry with my mother because to this day she is still with him after everything that happened",
  " I\u2019m saying all of this to say I am grateful for my life and I love me now but it took a long time for that to happen",
  " Please read my story and if you\u2019re going through something similar don\u2019t wait so long say something",

  "My born was, in the words of my parents: &#8216;a miracle&#8217;, from the fact that my mom achieved to get pregnant again, and to that I almost didn&#8217;t make it&#8230; Mom faced difficulties, and at the end we made it, when I was born everything was fine, or at least the doctors say so",
  "After few months, when it was time to stimulate my first steps, the unexpacted shows up",
  " I used to make some weird moves with my legs and be in constant &#8216;splits&#8217; instead of kind of keep me standing",
  " My parents get surprised and with the confussion the visits to one doctor, and other, and other more begun; no one knew what exactly happened to me, until they find out: Bilateral congenital dysplasia of hips, this condition could be discover at my born, it did not; this condition is in few words: To do not have the bones (acetabulums) that connect femurs with hips",
  " First evaluation: &#8216;Your child would never walk&#8217;, of course the heart and world of my parents get broken but, after many evaluations a little hope arrived, a innovated treatment, of course my parents were so desesperated that they were willing to try wathever; they swear that even though I didn&#8217;t have an usual developmeent I never gave up, I tried to stand, to walk, to croll even when my body could not made it, with a lot of time, patience, spport, and against all dianoses, little bones get appeared, so the hope started to increse",
  " Maybe I would be able to walk and I finally did when I was two year old",
  "Me walking changes my family life and of course it define mine, I&#8217;m sadly sure that life would not be the same to me, and I can say &#8216;sadly&#8217; because being desable should not be an obstacle to growth and achieve a good life, but discrimination exists, lack of inclusion is a fact, and the whole structural mistakes that dismiss the potential on our disable community has not vanished",
  " Now, I have embraced my past to strengh my goals for the future, to sensibilize my vision for the future and my treat to others, because now I can, yes with some aftermaths, but what do they matter, my family and I didn&#8217;t give up then, what would I give up upon anthing else now",

  " And that is not it",
  " I am a neurodivergent community member, and what once make me feel ashame now makes me powerfull, free, brilliant, proud, different and happy",
  " When I was 3 year old I was diagnosed with ADHD: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder or what is call Attention Deficit Disorder, and certainly is not easy thing, my learning was not the usual, my challenges were different and not for all schoolar systems, teachers get upset and mad with me the whole time, my parents spend a lot of time in meetings, with doctors, following my treatment, and even though at the beggining I didn&#8217;t recognize my differences with other kids, later I get bullied, stressed an so confused by the misstreat or excess of attention of others",
  " The world make me feel different and that could be a a bad or an amazing thing",
  " It was and still is faboulous, now I&#8217;m not taking any pills, even thoug at my 16-17 years old it lead to anxiety, now I work my ADHD on my favor: Multitasking is my cardio, easy distraction my bend",
  "People used to tell me how I should deal with my &#8220;problem&#8221;, I decided how to work with my superpower",

  "&#8221; He returned to his dorm and I was walking with my friend to her dorm and she said &#8220;I don&#8217;t like the way he talks to you",
  " You should break up with him",
  "&#8221; Break up with him",
  " He loved me and was trying to help me be a better singer and actor",
  " Over the years he would criticize my singing so often that I convinced myself I was more a &#8220;straight show&#8221; actor than a singer",
  " I barely sang",
  " Roommates I had in my later days of college would hear me sing in the shower or goofing around in the car and say, &#8220;wait, you can sing",
  "&#8221; After an acting performance I was particularly proud of, a bunch of friends were complimenting me and he launched into a masterclass of all the things I could have done differently to make it better",
  " I would later realize he couldn&#8217;t stand the idea that I might be better than he was",
  " I stopped being friends with those boys from earlier",
  " The love of my life thought they were no good",
  " I stopped hanging out with friends from my Freshmen year of college because they partied a lot, and my boyfriend and I didn&#8217;t need alcohol to have fun",
  " I never drank while we were dating",
  " I put most of my jewelry back in the jewelry box",
  " I donated my polka dot clothes to charities",
  " I hardly ever painted my nails and wore little makeup",
  " I became very insecure in singing and acting, always hoping he&#8217;d tell me I was amazing and perfect, that he was proud of me",
  " He always had notes for me",
  " I can&#8217;t recall one moment of anything I ever did just being good",
  " And if the person who supposedly loved me most always had critiques, so must everyone else",
  " Things got worse before I woke up",
  " He would stay up all night long looking at things on the internet",
  " His religious views changed, and while I don&#8217;t have a problem with that, I was constantly lectured in why my views were wrong and stupid",
  "At some point during these late night research sessions he found a certain sex advice podcast",
  " He stopped believing in monogamy",
  " He started giving me books and having me listen to podcasts about why humans were not meant to be in one single relationship",
  " I loved him, and I wanted to be with him, and he made his case so strongly that I tried to see where he was coming from",
  " I remember opening one of the books and the opening paragraph describing how a penis was shaped the way it is to scoop out the other men&#8217;s sperm in a woman to make way for their sperm",
  " I remember slamming the book shut and being sick",
  " I have no problem with people who feel monogamy isn&#8217;t the lifestyle they want",
  " But I was firmly monogamous",
  " I hadn&#8217;t even felt attraction to a guy since I started dating my boyfriend",
  " I would have done anything for him, but I knew I wouldn&#8217;t be able to survive a change to him having multiple partners, and I had no desire to be with anyone but him",
  " We faught about it a lot and ultimately, we broke up",
  " I don&#8217;t remember much about that time beside watching Tangled on repeat and wondering what I could have done differently",
  " We also worked the same &#8220;acting survival&#8221; job",
  " It was a weird job that I won&#8217;t detail here, but I had to call him at least once a day for this job",
  " Another friend we had graduated with and who worked with us told me one day &#8220;I went to dinner with him and he started crying",
  " He wants you back",
  "&#8221; Not long after that he called me asking if we could talk",
  " I think we got back together that night",
  " We had been apart for only two months",
  " He didn&#8217;t want to be without me, and he would be monogamous if it meant having me back",
  " We lasted just about another year",
  " He moved into my tiny studio within weeks of us getting back together",
  " I hid it from friends and family for at least another month",
  " Spoiler alert, if you are hiding a relationship from your friends and family, it probably isn&#8217;t a healthy relationship",
  " During that year I discovered he had been cheating on me during the first go around",
  " He also began staying out all night with friends and he wouldn&#8217;t tell me when he was coming home or where he was",
  " I&#8217;d wake up at 3AM picturing him dead in a ditch somewhere",
  " And if I texted him or called him, I was jealous, I was insecure, I was crazy",
  " He wasn&#8217;t cheating, he&#8217;d say",
  " I was crazy",
  " I was jealous",
  " It was okay for him to have friends that weren&#8217;t me, but I just wanted to know when he&#8217;d be home, that he was alive",
  " If I&#8217;d ask for us to get together with these friends, the answer was always no",
  " He also began traveling a lot for work",
  " And if I wasn&#8217;t ready to jump into bed with him before he left or when he got back the fights were unreal",
  " Or sometimes he&#8217;d come home at 3/4/5 in the morning after being out all night with friends and want me to have sex",
  " And the sex was never good enough for him",
  " I was told to watch porn to get better and learn new positions, and order sex toys so I wouldn&#8217;t be be so tight, as some positions caused me pain",
  " If I was so bad at sex, why would I want to do it",
  "  It would just end in him criticizing me",
  "One day, around Valentine&#8217;s Day he wanted to have sex and I didn&#8217;t",
  " This turned into the fight that ended it all",
  " I had apparently never loved him, never appreciated who he was, and made everything about me",
  " I had done everything and anything he ever asked of me",
  " But I didn&#8217;t love him",
  " I couldn&#8217;t accept him",
  " Because I couldn&#8217;t accept him not wanting to be monogamous did that mean I didn&#8217;t accept him or love him",
  " Why couldn&#8217;t I just do the things he wanted me to do",
  " I was devastated and lost",
  " But, had he ever accepted me",
  " Had he ever tried to give me what I needed",
  " That wasn&#8217;t a thought I had back then",
  " Back then I shrivelled up and died inside at believing I had treated someone I loved so much so badly",
  " For months I blamed myself",
  " When he came to move his things out of the apartment I had written him a note about how sorry I was, that I had never meant to hurt him, that I didn&#8217;t know what was wrong with me that I could love someone so much and hurt them, that I was selfish and needed to get help",
  " And that I would always love and care about him",
  " And then he was gone",
  " I spent most of my time when not working on the couch binge watching TV",
  " One of my binge shows during this time was &#8220;American Horror Story",
  "&#8221; Why",
  " I have no idea",
  " At the end of the Asylum season, Jessica Lange&#8217;s character says a line that is something to the effect of &#8220;Don&#8217;t ever let a man tell you who you are or make you feel like you are less than he is",
  "&#8221;I sat bolt upright on the couch and paused the show",
  " Not long before we had broken up we had faught about something, I no longer remember what, and I had said to him &#8220;sometimes you just make me feel like I am so small and so stupid compared to you",
  "&#8221; In that moment (seriously, thanks Jessica) it was like a veil had been removed and I saw everything for what it was",
  " Emotional abuse",
  " Control",
  " Narcissism",
  " I didn&#8217;t even know who I was anymore",
  " I began rebuilding my life",
  " I bought polka dots",
  " I began wearing makeup and jewelry",
  " I was cast in a show where I had to sing, and every time a cast mate or audience member complimented my singing, I cried",
  " I&#8217;m not the same as I was before I met him",
  " I swore to myself I would never let what happened happen again, and I haven&#8217;t",
  " I know the signs and I&#8217;m wiser and stronger",
  "In most ways I am strong and confident in who I am",
  " I am not willing to change who I am, and I am okay with people not liking that person",
  " I&#8217;m fiercely feminist and an advocate for what I want",
  " I still listen to constructive criticism and feedback, but I&#8217;m able to determine what I agree with and what I don&#8217;t",
  "  But it has meant it being very hard for me to trust people and very hard for me to be vulnerable with men",
  " I know it&#8217;s why I&#8217;m still single",
  " I know it&#8217;s why I have had feelings for a guy for almost 6 years and am still afraid to tell him",
  " I don&#8217;t want to trust my heart to the wrong person again",
  "Like I said before, this isn&#8217;t a story I tell often",
  " Mostly because it&#8217;s embarrassing",
  " I always prided myself on being fiesty and feminist",
  " And I let a man totally control, change and rule me",
  " It took more time than it should have for me to understand the depths of his master manipulation, narcissism, gaslighting and power",
  " To forgive myself and stop blaming myself for not seeing it",
  " To not care if people that were still friends with him knew my side of the story",
  " And to know that I deserved more than what he gave me",
  "During all the time I dated this guy, it never crossed my mind that I was in an abusive relationship",
  " A lot of people told me they didn&#8217;t like him or didn&#8217;t like the way he talked to me sometimes",
  " Some of my friends even had experience with him trying to control them",
  " But they never told me, except that one girl, that I shouldn&#8217;t be with him, that I deserved more",
  "  We often ask &#8220;he hasn&#8217;t hit you, has he",
  "&#8221; But we never ask about emotional/mental damage",
  " It&#8217;s easy to miss damage that isn&#8217;t visible",
  " I still don&#8217;t like to say I am an abuse survivor because I was never physically abused",
  "  While I can&#8217;t even imagine the horror of physical or sexual abuse, I can tell you firmly that emotional abuse is real",
  " Watch out for your friends who you suspect are being controlled",
  " Call it out for what it is",
  " Help them get out",
  " No one deserves it",
  " And if you are with someone who makes you feel small or less or wrong all the time, get out",
  " You deserve to be loved for who you are,  polka dots, earrings, nail polish and all",

  "I am an army brat, born and brought up in an organization that protects the nation, however failed to protect my childhood and of so many others",
  "I was abused by a domestic helper, who used to come to take care of my father&#8217;s uniform",
  " I called him &#8220;bhaiya&#8221;, to me he was someone who was close to and would happily play will my younger 2 year old brother",
  " So I was OK hanging around him",
  " When mom dad had to go for official parties, he would stay with us till the time they weren&#8217;t back",
  "If you ask me how it began believe me I was too small and innocent to recall the details",
  " For a while I didn&#8217;t even understand what was happening",
  " I remember it in bits",
  " I remember feeling the pain",
  " I remember feeling dirty and shameful",
  " I remember questioning myself why is he doing this to me",
  " I remember running in another room and locking myself up to protect myself &amp; his asking me to come out otherwise we would wake my brother up",
  " I remember the day I gained courage to confronted him and told him I don&#8217;t like what he does and that I will tell my dad &amp; him asking me &#8220;What will you say",
  " What do I do to you",
  "&#8221; I remember answering I don&#8217;t know in my head",
  " Frankly, as a 6 year old, I really don&#8217;t know what I would have said",
  " If at all I had",
  "Have we really given children in our society a language to talk about abuse",
  " Later when it got to a point that I couldn&#8217;t take the physical pain anymore I choose to shout for help",
  " That was and still is my last call for help",
  "My screams were silenced as I saw him put a pillow on my sleeping brother&#8217;s face, pressing it and saying to me &#8220;I suffocate him to death, stay quite",
  "&#8221; That was the last time, I thought to tell my parents anything about it ever",
  " In my head, I knew I had to save my brother from him and that no matter what he did to me, I wouldn&#8217;t even whisper about it",
  " Silence became my only language for those 2 years",
  " I was scared to talk to anyone",
  " Thanks to my dad&#8217;s profession we moved every two years",
  " But even when we moved out of that place, I choose to hide this from my parents, mostly because I was scared what if he got back ",

  "I remember crying myself to bed several months after that",
  " The fear of seeing him surfaced again, every shadow looked like him, every dark room had him hidden in the corner, every stranger looking at me on the streets had his eyes",
  " I started having sleepless nights with dreams of my brother suffocating under the pillow",
  " I struggled to breathe as the memory of my body being in someone else&#8217;s control made my mind numb and the reality in those moments of helplessness became very delusional",
  " Thus started the struggle of my teenage years, with anger issues, aggression, emotional dysfunction, anxiety attacks &amp; thoughts of suicide",
  " With 3 serious attempts to end my life in 18 years, even death felt deceitful",
  " I hated the idea of existence, of this world, of life and of almost everything around me",
  " I didn&#8217;t trust anyone for a very long time",
  " And I became overprotected of children around me",
  "My abuse became a dark shadow, a demon under my bed, that chose to come out and seize my mind as and when it wanted to",
  "I tried everything, everything by the book, seeing a therapist, meditating, writing but just nothing seemed to help me in my pain and its psychosomatic manifestations",
  " That&#8217;s when I took the decision to tell my parents about the abuse, I was suffocating and was in much need of someone&#8217;s support",

  " They at first couldn&#8217;t understand or I should say believed that this could happen in the protected environment that we were raised in",
  " In addition they were blaming themselves",
  " A couple of years have passed we don&#8217;t talk about it at home, the last thing I want to do is hurt them and make them feel they failed to protect us",
  " However I am tired of ignoring it and behaving as if it never happened",

  "My life changed, when I got in touch with a team working towards prevention of child sexual abuse",
  " They encouraged me to be a personal safety trainer &amp; use my inherent protectiveness towards young children to empower them",
  " It&#8217;s been 3 years now, I have empowered 30,000 children with personal safety lessons, with the language to understand safe/unsafe touch, courage to say NO to the perpetrator at first contact &amp; report it to their trusted adults",
  " They know they will be believed and that we stand by them",
  " In addition I  work with parents on how to develop trust &amp; open communication with children &amp; how to identify signs of child sexual abuse (CSA) and report it",
  " I can&#8217;t say I have healed completely, I still have moments of trigger",
  " But with every child I empower, a part of me heals",
  " Nothing gives me more happiness than empowering children",
  " Seeing the courage &amp; trust in their eyes makes me stronger",
  " I live for only one mission, that no child has to ever suffer in silence, not knowing why &amp; what is happening",
  " Or believing that they are trapped or helpless",
  "I don&#8217;t wish to die anymore, But when the time comes, When I have to die, I want to die in a world that&#8217;s safe for our children",
  " That&#8217;s the dream, my only dream",
  "I end by sharing with you a small piece I wrote, when I first found my strength &amp; began my journey towards empowerment",
  " No pain can ever recover unless you endure it, let it be, accept it for what it has caused, put it behind you and move on to share the pain of others and prevent the younger generation from going through the same",

  " To say that this past year has been one of the toughest years of my life is such an understatement",
  " I have been through so many hardships",
  " From assault, being in the hospital, being placed in a domestic violence shelter then becoming homeless, to my life being turned completely around",
  " All within 5 months",
  "I guess for you to fully understand my story I\u2019ll need to take you back to the day that became my nightmare&#8230;On December 24th, 2018, at around 11 p",
  "m",
  " a man who I had only been acquainted with raped me",
  " It turned my world upside down",
  " I called 911 and had a female officer escort me down to the station where I spoke with a female detective",
  " They did everything they could to make this process easy for me, but no matter what they did or said it didn&#8217;t take that feeling inside of me away",
  " I felt so empty, devastated, numb, dirty, unworthy and ashamed",
  " I went to the hospital shortly after talking with the police and had a rape kit exam done on me",
  " I felt so scared and so alone, i literally had no one",
  " I just wanted to do the right thing",
  " While getting the exam some suicidal thoughts crept in, so I was forced to stay in the psychiatric part of the hospital for a few days",
  " From there I had been placed me in a Domestic Violence shelter because I needed a safe place to go",
  " I felt victimized all over again because the shelter didn&#8217;t really know what to do with me and wanted to send me somewhere else since I was sexually assaulted and not considered a Domestic Violence case",
  " I stayed in the shelter for a few months, but they had no more room for me",
  " I was forced to leave, becoming homeless and living in my car",
  " I honestly just began to feel so hopeless&#8230;life became meaningless to me",
  " I had already suffered nightmares every night and been dealing with the aftermath of the assault all on my own",
  "One day I decided to go sit in this coffee shop (Vibe Coffee) and as i sat down I began writing my suicide note because in my mind, I was done",
  " I knew that I didn&#8217;t have to struggle with this pain any longer",
  " As I was writing I remember stopping and looking out the window saying, &#8220;God if you are real SHOW ME",
  "&#8221; And as soon as those words rolled off my tongue, I heard a man across the room say Jesus&#8230;immediately everything in the coffee shop became silent to me, and all I heard was these two men speaking",
  " I got up and walked right up to both and said I want to know more about Jesus",
  " The conversation they were having was captivating",
  " Something about the name Jesus just drew me in",
  " After speaking with Matt (the man I walked up to) and Matt&#8217;s Friend, Matt asked me if I would meet his wife, Joanna",
  " Later that afternoon I met her and their two daughters",
  " I was just in awe of how compassionate they were towards me, a total stranger",
  " They allowed me to go eat dinner with them, and afterwards they all prayed over me",
  " I walked away that night more curious about Jesus than ever before",
  " What is even crazier is that the Lord connected us through Facebook the next day, and before I knew it these wonderful people allowed me to stay in their home",
  "I couldn&#8217;t believe it",
  " I was a total stranger&#8230;About two weeks later, I was sitting in Matt and Joanna\u2019s kitchen reading my Bible and listening to Matt and Joanna\u2019s music ( they are both Christian music artist) and this song by Joanna started playing called \u201cYour Wonderful Mercy\u201d and it was that song that led meto Jesus",
  " As that song was playing, I fell to my knees and asked Jesus to rescue me and to come into my life",
  " It was then that I felt fully alive and so loved",
  "Ever since the day I got saved I have learned that what was once my tragedy has now become my testimony",
  "I want people to see and know that what was meant for evil, God used for my good",
  " I may not have known Jesus during the assault, but it was through the assault and meeting Matt and Joanna Black that I was Rescued and Saved by a loving God",
  " I now attend \u201cThe Bridge\u201d house church every Sunday at Matt and Joanna Black\u2019s home",
  " God has truly done so much in and through the Black Family",
  " They allowed me a place to stay until I was stable enough to get back on my feet and they have shown unfailing love and support every step of the way",
  " They continue to support me on this newfound journey of sharing my story with others",

  "I was always an extrovert",
  " Dancing, being a part of every activity that took place and having a big group of friends was something that I knew I would always love",
  " However as I grew up I became less interested in activities, my friend circle just grew smaller and I became more depressed",
  " I was hard for me to accept the fact that I was depressed, it took me 1-2 years to realise it",
  " I didn&#8217;t want to break peoples expectations from me",
  " I did not want to become a failure",
  " Perhaps this was the reason I never truly accepted what I was feeling until all this came shattering down on me",
  " And I remember that day so clearly",
  " I was sitting alone with cellphone in my hand, looking through my contacts",
  " Tear were welling up in my eyes as I searched for a person whom I could call and talk to",
  " At that moment I just wanted someone to talk however I could not find anyone with whom I could share my personal feelings with",
  " I did not want to call my mother knowing that she will worry",
  " I remember thinking that this is it",
  " This is what my life is going to be like",
  " My chest was aching by thinking about being alone",
  " A loser",
  " I tried to calm myself, I could not cry, I thought maybe I was overthinking",
  " But I deep down knew what the truth was",
  " For me that moment felt like end of the world",
  " I didn&#8217;t knew what i would do, where would I go and how would I like",
  " For someone who had always been a extrovert it seemed like an end",
  " It still does",
  "I hope someone is out there you will pull my hand from this lonliness",
  "And I also want to reach out to people who have gone through the same phase or are going through",
  " I feel helping them out and understanding them can also eventually help me",

  "Dedication: I dedicate this to my cousins and nieces, who I love and care about more than I can say",
  "I had an amazing breakthrough a few months ago, and it completely changed my life, but let me start with some backstory, explaining why this decision became so instrumental in helping me become the person I always wanted to be",
  " Growing up, I was always surrounded by people drinking alcohol in excess",
  " It really bothered me most of the time",
  " I would watch my family completely change their behavior- become embarrassing, angry, unable to walk or speak normally, and I would think to myself, I never want to act like that, I never want to lose control of myself",
  " I was puzzled by the fact that a drink could really be so enticing that it would create such a need and let people allow themselves to become so lost",
  " But, it didn&#8217;t take long for me to lose that inner voice, and hear the outer voices of my peers inviting me to &#8220;join the party&#8221; and just try it out",
  " The first night I drank, it was excessive, very excessive",
  " I had no personal experience with alcohol and I allowed the same peers that led me toward this poison to instruct me on how much I should drink",
  " I spent the entire next day throwing up and regretting the decision",
  " But it didn&#8217;t stop me",
  " I was now a drinker",
  " Throughout the next 20 years, I would continue drinking, even when it almost killed me on my 21st birthday, when my boyfriend woke me up at 3am because I was choking on my vomit in my sleep",
  " It&#8217;s hard to say he saved my life, since he was also one of the peers that encouraged me to take my first drink",
  " I continued even after that relationship ended, leaving me single and on my own",
  " Drinking while dating seemed to be necessary, because I led myself to believe that there was no way that I would ever loosen up around these new, strange men without a couple drinks to &#8220;take the edge off&#8221;",
  " By this point, my drinking had become uncontrollable",
  " I didn&#8217;t know when to stop",
  " I would drink so much that my memory would shut off",
  " I would wake up the next morning in a strange place with a strange person, not remembering what brought me there or what exactly happened there",
  " Other times, I would wake up in my own bed, and not remember how I got there",
  " Once in a lifetime experiences I was so fortunate to have the opportunity to attend: concerts, sporting events, milestones in my life and in the lives of people I love, I don&#8217;t remember them",
  " I remember getting there, having a drink or two, and then, besides photos or videos that were taken, some of them so humiliating, I don&#8217;t remember how I felt or what I saw",
  " Wake up calls were ringing off the hook, but I never picked up",
  " I don&#8217;t have a grand experience that led me to finally drop the bottle",
  " I&#8217;m lucky in that sense",
  " I was never in a car accident, I never got a DUI, I never got seriously hurt",
  " Sexual assault, however, became a norm in my life, and that should never have happened",
  " I am a strong woman",
  " I know how to defend myself",
  " I know how to speak up",
  " Nobody tells me what I can or can&#8217;t do",
  " I am powerful",
  " Except, when alcohol takes over my body, it takes my power away from me",
  " It makes me frail, and weak willed",
  " It creates the opportunity for people to take advantage of me&#8230; and they will",
  " The day I decided to stop drinking alcohol was the day after I attended a concert",
  " Not a rock concert, or some grand festival where everyone is partying all night",
  " I was watching an orchestra",
  " I was attending the performance of the composer for Game of Thrones, and the guy I was seeing got us front row seats",
  " This is not the type of event one gets completely trashed at, but I did",
  " I don&#8217;t remember what happened after intermission, but I took lots of videos",
  " Watching those videos the next day was heart wrenching",
  " I kept them, in case I needed to see them again, but so far I haven&#8217;t",
  " The guy I was with expressed embarrassment for my behavior, in the front row yelling and even booing the musicians at one point (not for their music, more for my dislike of the final season of the show, but it was still entirely unnecessary)",
  " He also said that he felt sorry for me",
  " Earlier in the day, I was so excited for this show, I had been looking forward to it for so long, and by the end of the show, I was just angry&#8230; for no reason, just extremely emotional and angry",
  " I don&#8217;t even remember",
  "  That was almost 5 months ago",
  " I haven&#8217;t had a drink since",
  " I hoped that no longer drinking would eliminate the blackouts, stop my embarrassing behavior, and make me feel safer",
  " My hopes were met 10 fold",
  " I have my power back",
  " I always used to complain that no one took me seriously, and I was often the butt of jokes",
  " I am no longer a joke, I always have my wits and the only time people are laughing at me is when I&#8217;m laughing too",
  " I worried that the removal of alcohol would alienate me from many people in my life, and it really hasn&#8217;t",
  " Relationships have changed, and there was a lot to get used to, but it wasn&#8217;t at all what I imagined",
  " Quitting drinking is the best decision I&#8217;ve ever made, and as much as I regret what happened when I used to drink, without that, I might not have such a definitive decision to never even have one drink again",
  " Let me now tell you how much my life has changed in more ways that I could imagine since that random, not so special day in September of 2019",
  " Let&#8217;s start with the not so great stuff",
  " When I say &#8220;not so great&#8221;, I obviously don&#8217;t mean bad&#8230; because nothing was so bad that I have been tempted to drink, or regretted my decision to stop",
  " Drinking is what many people do to escape their problems",
  " I don&#8217;t have that escape anymore",
  " Instead, I have to deal with them, I have to think about them, and I have to do something about them",
  " This is not easy, and it often creates anxiety",
  " However, as the days pass, the anxiety eases up, and in the process, I&#8217;m learning how to ease my anxieties in natural and healthy ways",
  " I dance, I meditate, sometimes I beat my punching bag with so much fury that I am sore for 3 days after",
  " I have learned how to breathe, which is something I can do anywhere- at work, in my car, at functions, absolutely anywhere",
  " If I stop for a second, realize what is causing my anxiety, and figure out how to eliminate it with my mind instead of a substance, I can actually solve the problem instead of running away from it",
  " The anxiety also tends to creep up in those social situations where I used to drink, often in excess",
  " At a family party, or going on a date, playing in my darts league, watching football on Sundays, going out dancing, New Years Eve, my birthday, Christmas and Thanksgiving",
  " I used to show up to these gatherings at times thinking, &#8220;okay, I&#8217;ve got to get that first drink in my system and then I&#8217;ll be fine&#8221;",
  " You know what I realized",
  " Taking that 15-30 minutes to become comfortable is necessary in all of these situations",
  " It wasn&#8217;t the drink that made me comfortable, it was just the time",
  " Everyone is nervous at first, and everyone can become comfortable in a little bit of time without the alcohol",
  " If not, then simply leave",
  " Can you imagine that",
  " If I am in a place where I do not feel comfortable after some time, I can just leave",
  " My body is trying to tell me something, and instead of drowning out that inner voice, I listen to it",
  " I thought that alcohol made me fun, and entertaining, and funny",
  " It didn&#8217;t",
  " I&#8217;m still all of those things",
  " It took me awhile to realize that",
  " In fact, I have an even quicker wit than I thought",
  " And, instead of people laughing at me because of my drunkenness, they are laughing at me because I am naturally hilarious",
  " I don&#8217;t become the punchline anymore, because I took that power back by keeping my consciousness",
  " I am fully aware of everything that is happening around me, and not only am I super fun and entertaining, but I am also helping to keep others safe in their less than conscious states",
  " I have inspired many to drink less, I offer to drive people home when they are not able to do so, I can help someone to think twice before leaving with that stranger",
  " I am fun, funny, and protecting my friends",
  "Quitting alcohol has not solved all of my problems, and it has not cured my lack of motivation or created the ability to ignore red flags while dating, but it has opened the door of opportunity for me to focus solely on getting those priorities to the forefront",
  " So far, that one decision has made my skin brighter, I feel much healthier and rarely get sick, my mind is sharper, and I have lost over 20 pounds, without changing anything else about my lifestyle (yet",
  ")",
  " I still have not created the exercise or meditation habit that I strive for",
  " My nutrition still leaves much to be desired, and I am just starting to drink plenty of water everyday to stay hydrated",
  " But my life feels brand new",
  " Not everyone struggles with addiction to alcohol the way I did, but everyone struggles with something",
  " It takes dedication and strength, but once you figure out that big struggle that underlies everything that you&#8217;re missing out on in life, you have to fix it",
  " It took me so long to find that strength, but now that I have, I have changed my entire life and I have so much to look forward to and much less dread than I did in the past",
  " I have the ability to &#8220;Be Here Now&#8221; and to shine as a beacon of strength to those around me, especially the women and girls in my life",
  " I have always wanted to be that positive role model for all of my cousins&#8217; daughters (all 25 of them",
  ") and my nieces, and now, I believe that&#8217;s exactly what life was calling me to do, and what I truly am",

  "Dedication: I want to dedicate it to both women and girls, who feel that they have no voice in this society",
  "Society has coined us to believe that we are confined to a certain culture, lifestyle, beliefs of this world that determine wrong from right",
  " Guess what",
  " In this world, everyone has their truth, and nothing/no one can change that",
  " In my twenty-something years of existence, I have learnt that being bold and standing by the truth, makes people angry and no matter what you try to do and say you will never change anyone",
  " I have also learnt that peace of mind is golden without that, then everything becomes dysfunctional",
  " Take me back to 7years old when I discovered I could capture moments",
  " At the age of 16 while I was still trying to discover who I was and what I can do; I specialized in humanities because sciences were not my cup of tea",
  " At some point my dream was to become a lawyer then in a blink of an eye communications happened and it hit my soul different like a hot cup of tea would do",
  "When I turned 18, I felt that was my moment to make change, work hard and build my career",
  " They said the university would be fun and full of freedom",

  " The healthcare system failed me that night",
  " I managed to calm myself down and left the hospital where I came home and went straight to bed",

  " I conduct workshops, seminars and lectures on mental health and suicide prevention in youth through my little organization called &#8216;Empathy For You&#8217;I was in 12th when the issue of mental health hit me first",
  " I was going through that phase called &#8216;mini-depression&#8217;, and realized that most of the youngsters were facing the same problem at that time",
  " I went through this phase myself but got to know we need to talk about it and hear them out",
  "\u00a0Later then, I got a very different experience",
  " It was a bright sunny day in June, my sister was sitting on the edge of her bed",
  " I happened to accidentally open her room and what I found was, she was sitting with a bottle of pills in her left hand and heap of tablets in her right",
  " The ceiling lamp hanging on her and her computer open with a goodbye letter",
  " She had committed suicide",
  " What if for at least one time I would have spoken to her and not as a sister but as her friend",
  " Her goodbye letter said, she had a feeling that nobody loves her, nobody needs her and her existence is ruthless",
  " I lost my sister due to depression and anxiety",
  "Recently, I founded a nonprofit organization called &#8220;Empathy 4 You&#8221;, working for raising mental health awareness and breaking the stigma of mental health in the youth",
  " Initially, I used to counsel people online via social media",
  " It wasn&#8217;t prof counseling at that time, but at least I was able to read and understand them",
  " And till now, I have counseled 600 people, the happiness I get after seeing smile on someone&#8217;s smile because of me is what keeps me going",
  " Later then, we started conducting lectures, seminars in schools and colleges for raising mental health awareness among the youth through E4U",
  "\u00a0Recently we also collaborated with a California Based organization called &#8216;Letters to Strangers&#8217;",

  " This goal is derived from my own life experiences as I have rebuilt my entire life",
  " My journey began in my childhood; at age eleven I was placed into the foster care system separated from my siblings",
  " This was a major challenge in my life as I struggled to adapt to the system",
  " I often ran away and did not attend school",
  " I was on my own at sixteen-years-old when my birth parents found me; I went to live with them in another state",
  " They were living with my aunt and uncle in Tennessee",
  " My aunt was an amazing role model to me and pushed for me to obtain my GED, which was a major blessing in my life",
  " Despite my wrong choices she always saw a light in me that I could not see for myself",

  " By the time I was nineteen I had two children and no way to support them",
  " My sons\u2019 father and I were married very young and his alcoholism made him extremely abusive",
  " Most often I found myself with two kids and nowhere safe to go",
  " Their paternal grandparents pushed for me to allow them to adopt them and give them a life they deserved with the promise that I could always be in their lives",
  " This decision became the foundation to which my drug addiction was born",
  " My downward spiral continued for approximately six years as I was in and out of jails and institutions a few years later I had another child named Kaylee",

  " My journey does not end there however, in 2015 I began battling suicidal ideation; I had always struggled with mental illness",
  " This was caused by trauma in my childhood and the genetic component of mental illness as my maternal grandmother and both my parents have various conditions",
  " I went to see a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with bipolar 1, I had received this diagnosis at sixteen as well while in a state-funded group home",
  " I knew there was so much about me that still needed to change, I wanted to be a better mother, wife, sister, and friend",

  " I attribute this to not attending enough and not being on the right medications",
  " The first year at Post was the hardest, I had to push myself while receiving a lot of extra help from my professor\u2019s and the disability department",

  " We made eye contact, said hello, and went our own way",
  " Few days after that I had a water leak in my apartment and needed maintenance to come take a look",
  " When maintenance showed up to fix the leak,,HE, the stunning, tall, young man I saw at the mailbox was with the maintenance guy(planned lol)",
  " I welcomed them in and showed the leak problem and continued about my chores while they took a look",
  " The mailbox guy introduced himself as Corey",
  " We started chatting and sharing a bit about ourselves and that&#8217;s how it all started",
  " Our love story began that day",
  " Corey and I had an amazing courtship and he absolutely fell in love with my daughter as well as me",
  " We had so much fun and started to build our little family until Oct 1998 when it all began, when our world came crashing down",
  " Corey was running a bit late getting home from work,,, I had made supper and set the table",
  " He finally showed up and had a horrible nose bleed",
  " We couldn&#8217;t get it to stop so I rushed him to the emergency room",
  "  I sat out in the waiting room while I figured they probably got the nose bleed under control and we would be on our way home",
  "  Not the case&#8230;",
  "the nurse came out to the waiting room and called my name and said I could go to Corey&#8217;s room with him,,he was being admitted",

  " I didn&#8217;t have much of a relationship with God at this time so I would spend the next few years trying to tackle life,  leukemia,  being a mommy,  a fiance, etc on my own",
  " Corey decided along with his family that it would be a good idea for him to move back home to fight his battle with Leukemia",
  " So that&#8217;s what happened and I packed my things and my baby girl Jessica&#8217;s things and we went home with Corey to love him through his battle with Leukemia",

  "  In the fall of 1994, a terrible thing happened, and I became a victim myself",
  "  It can take just moments to turn an innocent person into a victim",
  " But how long does it take to turn a victim into a survivor",
  "  For me, it took 247 days and nights to know that I was a survivor\u2026 And another 22 years to really start feeling like one",

  "  We are having so much fun planning our future, expecting that something truly magical is just about to happen",
  " I remember that time so clearly because it ended very abruptly and suddenly",
  "Just three weeks later, on the evening of October 4th, I was abducted from the streets of my town while on my way home",
  " They drugged me and drove to another country, where they kept me prisoner in a tiny room at first, and then under a house in a pit",
  "  The kidnappers spoke a language I did not understand",
  "  I didn\u2019t have a toothbrush, comb, no other clothing or even spare underwear",
  "  Every day, I had to knock on the door to my room, so that a gunman would let me out and walk me to the bathroom under his supervision",
  "During my first days in captivity, I had no idea where I was, why I was there, and I didn\u2019t even understand what anyone was saying",
  "  After a while they told me I was kidnapped, and they tried to ransom me back to my mother",
  "  They told me I was taken to Chechnya",
  "  Every day was the same \u2013 it did not come to an end, but transitioned to the next, looking exactly like the previous one",
  "  Short dreamless nights turned into endless and pointless days, full of hope in the morning and sorrow by nightfall",
  "  I would have preferred to never wake up at all until the day of my salvation",
  "  I was pretty certain that one dark night, salvation would come",
  "  Special police forces \u2013 a SWAT team \u2013 would storm into the building and save me",
  " A few weeks later, a brutal civil war broke out",
  "  Chechnya had declared its independence from Russia, and Russia would not allow it",
  "  A great army invaded the tiny country, yet no SWAT TEAM was coming for me",
  "  All contacts were cut off and the country plunged into darkness",
  " There was no electricity or telephone service, meaning no more negotiations for my release",
  "  I felt like one lost soul, totally feeble at the mercy of hardened killers in a land where innocent people were dying every day",
  "  But now, these gangsters suddenly saw themselves as patriotic freedom fighters, and I was their enemy \u2013 the face of the invader",
  " Events went from bad to worse",
  "  Life became very cheap, very quickly, and Chechnya became an apocalyptic killing zone",
  "  I was always in darkness, always under threat",
  "  The captors threatened to cut me into pieces and shoot me",
  "  I saw things I can\u2019t bear to think about, and I witnessed the horror of war",
  "One morning while I was being held, my captors suddenly decided to take me out of the room and outside",
  " They covered my eyes and drove me somewhere",
  "  I had no idea why or where, being blindfolded for a while",
  "  When the car stopped and I removed the bandage I saw the evidence of the recent fighting &#8211; bullet-scarred buildings charred by fire, burned out Russian tanks and trucks thrown askew like broken toys",
  "  The trees were bare, and the new snow that barely covered the ground was mixed with mud and blood, white and brown, with jarring smears of bright red",
  "  The buildings were destroyed, crushed and smashed as if by an army of giants",
  "  I figured we were right in downtown Grozny",
  " They parked near a large tree with massive naked branches spreading out to the sides",
  "  Needless to say, I was in shock",
  "  I was just staring through the window almost paralyzed by the view",
  "  I have never seen a war that close",
  "I noticed something was lodged between the thick branches",
  "  It wasn\u2019t one something &#8211; there were several of them and at every crook of the bald tree, one of these things had been carefully placed",
  "  I stared and stared at them, trying to make out what they were",
  "  One of the captors said: \u201cThat\u2019s what will be left of all the Russians who come to our country",
  "\u201dThe things on the branches were human heads",
  "  Cut-off heads of Russian soldiers \u2013 plastered with mud and blood \u2013 decorated the tree like Christmas bulbs",
  "  For a moment, I thought I would vomit or pass out",
  " Around me in the car, the gangsters prattled among themselves in their undecipherable language, their voices excited and cheerful",
  "  They were happy and jubilant",
  "  This atrocity, this disgrace\u2026 for them, it was a victory to be celebrated\u2026  Through eight horrifying months of captivity, witnessing atrocities, surviving bombings and sexual violence, I fought desperately to stay alive, stay sane, and not to lose the one thing that kept me going: my hope",
  "  Only hope and faith sustained me in moments of total and all-embracing despair",
  "I lacked the most basic things in life, but I could find a way to adjust and live without them",
  " The most difficult was an unbearable anguish and thoughts about my loved ones, as the emotional torture was so sharp that in some moments, I would\u2019ve been happy to die",
  "  To simply diminish, fall asleep and never wake up",
  "But I survived, and I lived to tell my story and be able to deliver the most important thing that I have learned in my captivity and after it: we always have a choice &#8211; stay strong or break down",
  "  Choose to remain a victim or choose to become a survivor",
  "  Was I a victim",
  "  Yes",
  "  At the time, I definitely was",
  "   I was a victim of gangsters who were engaged in organized crime and kidnapping, and I was also the victim of a war I knew nothing about and wanted no part of",
  "  I was a double victim",
  "  A triple victim",
  "  A quadruple victim if you count everything that happened",
  "  I saw and experienced things no one should have to go through",
  "  At certain moments in this life, we are all victims",
  "  People steal from us, or we get very sick &#8211; perhaps we get cancer",
  "  We lose our loved ones and incredible tragedies happen in our lives",
  "But I believe we are bigger and stronger than the things that happen to us",
  "  At some point \u2013 I&#8217;m not sure when \u2013 I decided for myself that I wanted to be a survivor, not a victim",
  "  I like being a survivor: A survivor moves forward, learns from the past, makes use of it, and ultimately, transcends it",
  "I like to believe we can all make that choice, no matter the hardships we face in life",

  "Despu\u00e9s de disfrutar de una adolescencia privilegiada dentro de los est\u00e1ndares de mi pa\u00eds, incluyendo mudarme a vivir a una ciudad a 4 horas de distancia de mi casa para asistir a una excelente universidad, pas\u00e9 a vivir a los Estados Unidos en una de las ciudades m\u00e1s interesantes y a la vez mas atemorizantes que hab\u00eda podido conocer",
  "Queens, NY se convirti\u00f3 en mi nuevo lugar de residencia por una elecci\u00f3n no propiamente personal",
  " Llegu\u00e9 a la gran manzana para volverme una experta no s\u00f3lo en sistema de los trenes de la ciudad sino tambi\u00e9n en el sistema de visitas a algunas de las c\u00e1rceles estatales de la regi\u00f3n",
  " Mi padre, quien siempre hab\u00eda sido mi h\u00e9roe y amigo, tuvo que asumir las consecuencias de sus malas decisiones a trav\u00e9s de una sentencia que lo arrastr\u00f3 a \u00e9l y a nuestra familia en un viaje lleno de inseguridad y angustia",
  "Viv\u00ed en casa de diferentes familiares con la suerte de tener en ocasiones una cama para dormir y en otras un sof\u00e1 que se convert\u00eda cada noche en mi habitaci\u00f3n",
  " Mi ropa siempre estuvo perfectamente acomodada en una caja de cart\u00f3n la cual era mi closet m\u00f3vil y hasta una guitarra que nunca toqu\u00e9 fue mi compa\u00f1\u00eda durante la traves\u00eda",
  " La adolescente privilegiada pas\u00f3 r\u00e1pidamente a ser una joven con nostalgia y frustraci\u00f3n por lo que hab\u00eda dejado atr\u00e1s pero tambi\u00e9n pas\u00f3 a ser una mujer fuerte llena de retos y con una clara decisi\u00f3n para sobrevivir",
  "Aprend\u00ed a valorar lo sencillo de la vida y a reconocer que valemos por quienes somos y no por lo que tenemos",
  " Entend\u00ed que mi t\u00edtulo y lo vivido en la \u00e9poca de la universidad no era lo que me defin\u00eda",
  " La fuerza que ten\u00eda para trabajar como una inmigrante necesitada de ganar dinero no solo para mi propio mantenimiento sino para poder apoyar a mi padre era lo que realmente demostraba quien era yo",
  " Muchas veces sent\u00ed rabia por vivir una situaci\u00f3n que sab\u00eda no hab\u00eda sido creada por m\u00ed y me lamentaba por no estar en el lugar que en ese momento cre\u00eda era lo que realmente merec\u00eda",
  " Llor\u00e9 cuando tuve que caminar con los zapatos rotos por las calles de Manhattan, cuando tuve que vender parte de mi ropa y joyer\u00eda para poder cubrir mis gastos, incluyendo gigantescas cuentas telef\u00f3nicas para que pap\u00e1 pudiera comunicarse con nuestra familia en casa",
  " A pesar de todo esto, tambi\u00e9n me sent\u00ed feliz cuando descubr\u00ed el oto\u00f1o y la primavera",
  " Un nuevo mundo se abri\u00f3 al empezar a comunicarme en otro idioma y al estar expuesta a otras culturas",
  " Ese nuevo mundo me permit\u00eda reconocer que cada peque\u00f1o logro representaba una gran victoria para mi vida",
  "Fueron casi tres a\u00f1os de aprendizaje los que marcaron una de las mejores etapas de formaci\u00f3n en mi vida",

  " Entend\u00ed lo maravilloso que es minimizar los apegos y el poder re\u00edr a pesar de las dificultades",
  " Entend\u00ed que, aunque mis ojos vieran solo nubes grises con certeza m\u00e1s arriba exist\u00eda un precioso cielo azul sonriendo para m\u00ed",
  " Creo que en medio de todas las experiencias dif\u00edciles en nuestra vida siempre hay algo bueno que recordar",
  " Estoy agradecida con todas y cada uno de los momentos vividos con mi familia y amigos, con el pa\u00eds que me recibi\u00f3 y ante todo con Dios por usar cada circunstancia para ense\u00f1arme a ser m\u00e1s fuerte en la vida",

  "After having a privileged adolescence in my native country, including going to a very well known university 4 hours away from my parents\u2019 house, I found my self living in the United States specifically in one of the most interesting and frightening cities that I knew",
  " Queens, NY became my new place of residence but not by personal choice",
  " I got to the \u201cBig Apple\u201d to learn the train system and to also learn the ins and outs visiting of some of the state jails",
  " My father, who was always was my friend and hero, had to live with the consequences of his bad decisions through a sentence that took him and our family into a journey full of insecurity and anxiety",
  "I lived in the homes of many relatives, in some occasions with the luck to have a bed to sleep in but in many others with a sofa that converted at night into my bed",
  " My clothes were always neatly organized in a cardboard box which I called \u201cmy mobile closet\u201d and I even carried a guitar that was my companion throughout the journey, although I never had the chance to learn how to play it",
  "The privileged adolescent was quickly transformed into a young woman with nostalgia and frustration for all that was left back home, but also transformed in a strong woman full of challenges and a clear decision to survive",
  "Appreciating the simple things in life and recognizing that our value is based on who we are and not in what we have was my new lesson",
  " I understood that my education and all the good times at the university were not really me",
  " The strength to work as a blue-collar immigrant in order to be able to provide not only for myself, but also to support my father, was what truly defined me at that time",
  " I have to say that I felt full of anger many times for having to live through such a difficult situation and I also found myself wanting to be in a better place \u2026 the place that I thought I deserved",
  "I remember crying when I had to walk with broken shoes in Manhattan and when I had to sell part of my clothing and jewelry in order to cover my own living expenses and the astronomical phone bills so that my father could communicate with our family back home",
  " Despite all that sadness I also felt happiness when I discovered the beautiful colors of autumn and spring",
  " A new world was opened to me when I was able to communicate with others in a different language and when I was exposed to other cultures",
  " That new world allowed me to see that every little achievement represented a huge victory in my life",
  "It was an almost three years learning process that marked one of the best developmental periods in my life",
  " I graduated with honors thanks to the lived experiences, which thought me the real meaning of love and friendship",
  " I recognized how good it feels when there are few physical attachments and when we can laugh despite the difficult times",
  " I understood that regardless of the gray clouds in front of my eyes there was definitely a beautiful blue sky on top smiling for me",
  "Today, I am sure that amongst all the difficult experiences in our lives there is always something good to gain out of them",
  " I am thankful for each experience that I had with family and friends, grateful with the country that opened its doors to me, and I am especially thankful to God for using all these circumstances to show me how to be bold and strong",

  "  Despite that incident I liked this guy and worked well with him, so I let it pass, after all I had dealt with it\u2026 right",

  "  When he got really explicit I told him to back off and said he had no respect for me",
  "  I asked him how he would feel if someone spoke to his wife like that",

  "  He grabbed me and pressed his mouth over mine",
  "    Inside my head my silent voice screamed for help but my mouth wouldn\u2019t let a single sound out",
  "  Something shocked my soul straight out of my body and it hovered at the bottom of the bed as I watched him abuse my body",

  "\u201d  I nodded, unable to speak as tears run down my cheeks",
  "  He left and I immediately run a bath and began to scrub my body",
  "  I was numb and shocked and I couldn\u2019t get clean",
  "  Tears rolled down my cheeks and my thoughts turned to \u201cThis is what people on television do when they have been raped\u201d My brain was arguing with me though as I was thinking \u201cIt can\u2019t be rape as you didn\u2019t stop him\u201d",
  "  I turned on the shower and stood up, desperate to get out of the dirty, contaminated bath water",
  "  The bath emptied and I immediately filled it again, desperate to sit in the water as the shower couldn\u2019t reach the bits I needed to cleanse",
  "  I felt so dirty, so ashamed",
  "  How could I have let myself get into that situation",
  "  No one would ever know what he had done",
  " It was my shame to carry",
  "My head went into autopilot as I had to meet our colleagues for dinner and I needed to look \u201cNormal\u201d",
  "  I sat with my colleagues, 3 other men and HIM and ate dinner like nothing had happened",
  "  The only way to get over this was to pretend it didn\u2019t happen",
  "  It was the only way I could survive",
  "  After dinner I made my excuses and returned to my room",
  "  I began to undress for bed",
  "  There was a knock at the door so I put on a robe and opened the door",
  "  He was back and he was smiling",
  "  He pushed past me and the door closed behind him",
  "  He pulled off my robe",
  "  I didn\u2019t stop him",
  "  It didn\u2019t matter I was already dirty and violated",
  "  He left straight afterwards and inside I felt dead",
  "  That night he murdered my soul",
  "  Somehow, I did the whole scrubbing thing again and ended up in my bed with a towel around my wet hair and the sheets sticking to my damp body",
  "  I\u2019m not sure if I slept or where my head was but soon it was morning and time to get ready for day 2 of the conference",
  "  I acted normal because the alternative was people would know",
  "  I could never let anyone know",
  "  I would rather die",
  "I returned home later that day",
  "  I felt like I had a neon sign above my head and everyone would know",
  "  I desperately didn\u2019t want my husband to touch me in case he would sense the change in me",
  "  I thought he would immediately know I was dirty now",
  "  I opened a bottle of wine, poured a glass and gulped it like a marathon runner who needed the hydration",
  "  My husband wanted to know why I was guzzling the wine",
  "  I snapped at him and told him I was tired after the long drive",
  "  I just needed to drink and forget about the previous night",
  "  I needed to silence the demons and I think it was an elixir for them as it appeared to numb them for a while",
  "For the next 3 months I followed the same routine",
  "  Go to work, keep busy, come home, get drunk, go to bed and silently sob into my pillow hoping no one would hear",
  "  I felt like the filth was coursing through my body, infecting me like some inner virus that eventually was going to be so obvious that everyone would see it",
  "  My colleague was no longer my friend",
  "  He had achieved his goal and was now suddenly too busy to talk to me",
  "  I was hurt and confused",
  "  I needed answers",
  "  When he did talk to me it was to tell me that his wife was stalking me",
  "  She was obsessed by me and was going to contact my husband and tell him about my \u201caffair\u201d",
  "  Desperate for the dirty secret to stay hidden I emailed her and tried to explain that there was no affair and I was not and never had been attracted to her husband",
  "  No one could ever know about the abuse",
  "  I\u2019d rather die",
  "Then fate stepped in and I suffered a bad house fire",
  "  I burst into tears and the floodgates opened",
  "  At that point, even Noah couldn\u2019t have kept me afloat",
  "  My husband wanted to know why I was so upset over a house",
  "  Material things had never been that important to us and he was confused",
  "  At last though I had something to blame for the tears and I didn\u2019t have to hide them for a while",
  "  I had a reason to cry",
  "  I repeated it like a mantra \u201cIt\u2019s the stress of the fire\u201d",
  "  Some people even looked like they believed me but it gave me no comfort",
  "  I kept drinking to make the thoughts go away and if I drank enough it would knock me out so that I could sleep for a couple of hours",
  "  I was exhausted and I began to look ill as the weight fell off me",
  "  I went to the doctor to be signed off work due to the house fire",
  "  I sobbed and sobbed and begged to be STI tested",
  "  I needed to know that the contamination coursing through me wasn\u2019t going to infect my husband",
  "  My tests were clear but I still felt dead inside",
  "I drank every night to get to sleep and then woke a couple of hours later as the anaesthetic effects wore off",
  "  My head replayed that night over and over like a badly made porn video with no sound",
  "  Each night I tried to answer my questions about why I didn\u2019t fight",
  "  Like wakening early from a dream and wanting to add an ending to it to tie up the loose ends, I desperately wanted to change the way I reacted that night",
  "  I wanted to scream and shout and fight and do everything that I always thought I would have done \u201cShould that ever happen to me\u201d",
  "  I hated myself for being so weak",
  "  I couldn\u2019t bear to look at my husband; the man I adored, because I felt like I had cheated on him",
  "  I had allowed another man to use my body",
  "  I should have been able to stop him",
  "  I was so ashamed",
  "Eventually my husband rolled over in bed, when I thought I was crying silently",
  "  He said \u201cI hear you crying every night",
  "  I can tell by your breathing",
  "  You need to tell me what\u2019s wrong- and don\u2019t blame the house fire\u201d",
  "  I couldn\u2019t hide the crying any more as I sobbed \u201cI can\u2019t tell you",
  " I can\u2019t\u201d",
  "  The last thing I wanted was for him to see the filthy me",
  "  He insisted I tell and as I unburdened the worst secret of my life I felt like a weight was being released from my body",
  "  Unfortunately, I watched his face crumble as his life imploded and my heavy, filthy secret began to crush his soul instead",
  "  Hurting him so badly tore my heart out and I immediately wished I could snatch the secret back, but it was too big, too heavy and too free now",
  "He was broken as I begged him to believe me that I didn\u2019t want him to do it to me",
  "  He shouted at me \u201cIf you didn\u2019t want it \u2013 that\u2019s rape\u201d",
  "  I cried \u201cIt was my fault I didn\u2019t stop him\u201d",
  "  He repeated \u201cIf you didn\u2019t want it \u2013 that\u2019s rape\u201d",
  "    I had been blaming myself for so long I was confused",
  "  I called Rape Crisis as I needed answers",
  "  As soon as the woman answered the phone I cried and cried and sobbed out the whole story; the sexual harassment, the friendship, the exposure, the confusion and the shame\u2026\u2026  She listened and told me that I had no reason to feel guilty as I had been raped",
  "  It didn\u2019t make sense",
  "  I\u2019d seen rape on Crimewatch",
  "  It was carried out by strangers with knives not friends who tell you they adore you",
  "  He said it was my fault for looking so sexy that he couldn\u2019t resist",
  "  I was still confused but felt that I needed to report him to the police for the abuse",
  "  He had sent me a photograph of his erection and I knew that was illegal",
  "The police arrived at my house a couple of hours later",
  "  I wasn\u2019t prepared",
  " I was in shock as I had only just said it out loud to myself",
  "  I was still confused",
  "  I still thought it was my fault",
  "The policewoman was a SOLO \u2013 a sexual offenses liaison officer",
  "  She questioned me for 10 hours solid",
  "  I cried and I kept repeating \u201cIt was my fault as I didn\u2019t stop him\u201d",
  "  The day turned to night and darkness",
  "  My house had no electricity after the house fire and she used her torch to light up her notebook as she took my statement",
  "  I hadn\u2019t eaten anything for 24 hours and I had no support",
  "  I was confused and desperately wanted my husband",
  "  I needed to know he was coping with this news",
  "  I knew I wasn\u2019t",
  "  Eventually at 11",
  "30pm the SOLO left with my 35 page statement, which I had signed without reading as I just wanted her to go",
  "Seven weeks later he was detained and gave a \u201cNo comment\u201d interview",
  "  They released him without charge",
  "   The police told me there was insufficient evidence to charge him",
  " When I protested the SOLO told me not to tell her how to do her job and said \u201cIt\u2019s not nice for someone who has never been in trouble with the police before to be detained",
  "\u201dI thought now that I had told, everything would be okay",
  "  That\u2019s what people tell you isn\u2019t it",
  "  That\u2019s what the media tell you",
  " \u201cNo matter how long ago it happened",
  "  You will be listened to",
  "  You will be believed",
  "\u201dSomeone told me \u201cThe truth is like a lion, set it free and it will defend itself\u201d So I set the beast free",
  "It didn\u2019t defend itself",
  "  It ruined my life",
  "  You see our society can\u2019t cope with the truth, so people find it easier to call you a liar and demand you prove your abuse",
  "I reported him to my employer for sexual harassment",
  "  I gave specific details of his abuse and they called me a liar",
  "  I had been telling my boss and my colleagues about his behaviour for 3 years but we were friends so they said I consented to his abuse",
  "  He admitted sending me the indecent image but said I sent him indecent images too",
  "  I knew I didn\u2019t so I asked to see them",
  "  They said he had deleted them now",
  "  He reported me for harassing his wife because I had emailed her while he was threatening me she was going to tell my husband",
  "  They upheld his complaint",
  "He said we\u2019d been having an affair for 3 years and I was a jilted lover",
  "  They said he was the victim and I was vindictive and vexatious",
  "  My employer told me I should have said NO more than once",
  "  They said I agreed to a wine with my colleague so therefore they believed the sex was consensual",
  "  I wanted to die",
  "  I was telling the truth and no one would listen",
  "  I was suffering panic attacks and flashbacks",
  "  I didn\u2019t want to leave the house",
  "  I felt constantly afraid and constantly sick",
  "  I couldn\u2019t trust my own judgement anymore",
  "  My health hit rock bottom",
  "  I was diagnosed with PTSD and prescribed antidepressants and sleeping pills",
  "  I began to feel like it was easier when I told no one \u2013 denial didn\u2019t hurt as much as being called a liar",
  "My employer dragged my grievance out for almost a year then sacked me",
  "  At each stage they tried to bully me into silence",
  "  I fought back because I knew I was telling the truth",
  "  The union funded my legal representation and at last I felt like I had someone on my side",
  "  The company dragged the legal fight out for more than 2 years",
  "  I was unable to work",
  "  A date was set for the employment tribunal and the solicitors started to negotiate",
  "  3 weeks before the tribunal my solicitor said the company had agreed to settle out of court and would pay me a little over one year\u2019s wages",
  "  I told them I didn\u2019t want to settle as I wanted justice, not money",
  "  They said if I didn\u2019t accept this \u201cReasonable offer\u201d the union would be minded to withdraw my legal funding",
  "  How could less than 2 years wages be reasonable after losing, a job I loved, my career, my company car, my reputation and my mental health",
  "  They supported a rapist and blamed me repeatedly for over 3 years",
  "  They drove me to attempt suicide and put my family through hell",
  "  I spent hours at a time curled up in a corner on the kitchen floor desperate to feel safe",
  "Not accepting the offer would lose me the settlement and the chance to repay the 30k debts I had accumulated while being unemployed",
  "  It would also mean I would have to pay 20k+ to find new legal representation and the company also threatened if I took this to court and was awarded less than what they had offered I would be burdened with their legal costs too for forcing it to tribunal",
  " If you accuse a large company of not protecting your human rights \u2013 they can pay their way out of the legal system",
  "  Make a \u201creasonable offer\u201d and the victim is deemed to be unreasonable for not wanting money",
  "  All I wanted was to be listened to, to be believed and safeguarded",
  "  All I wanted was to go to work and earn a living",
  "  Once again, I was bullied into silence",
  "  Eventually I couldn\u2019t risk losing the family home",
  "  My family had suffered enough",
  "  I agreed to accept the settlement and an apology because I couldn\u2019t afford not to",
  "  I refused point blank to sign any confidentiality and vowed that I would tell everyone what had been done to me",
  "Our society isn\u2019t geared up at all to support victims of sexual harassment",
  "  No wonder victims don\u2019t report",
  "  So, the next time you want to point the finger at someone who won\u2019t report sexual harassment without support from other victims, consider this and let my story be a warning to those who think reporting is easy",
  "  If I had not reported I would be financially better off and still have a job",
  "  The legal system tells me you should let men abuse you and stay quiet because even if you \u201cWin\u201d your case, (and there is about as much chance of that as there is of getting a rape conviction) you will be broken, damaged and financially penalised",

  "My life changed about four years ago when I started to have anxiety and panic attacks",
  " I only had them at work in a small cooler",
  " I knew what it was about but I fought myself for a few months, I kept promising myself it would get better and they would go away",
  " In the back of mind and in my soul I knew that was a lie and they  would not go away until I got help",
  " I finally found a therapist and told my supervisor at work the day before my first appointment the reason why I was going",
  "I was molested when I was ten years old by an older boy that my family knew",
  " I never received help before",
  " I had spoke up when I was 17 but that was a huge flop",
  " The high school counselor and the state social worker didn&#8217;t really explained anything to me",
  " As well they involved another counselor and between the three of them lead me to believe that I would be &#8220;cured&#8221; in 6 sessions",
  " They made it seem that it was no big deal",
  " I knew it was though",
  " I didn&#8217;t connect with the counselors and choose to not get help because I felt all the help out there would be like the two ladies",
  " I felt disconnected with the helping world, and uneducated",
  " Fast forward many years later, during the time the social worker died, so did the guy",
  " So the anxiety and panic attacks started a few years later",
  " As I sat the first day in the parking lot arguing with myself that I wasn&#8217;t that much in need of help, I smartly texted my supervisor is also a very, very dear friend",
  " She was able to convey through texts in her mom voice, that I must go inside and get help",
  " It worked",
  " I listened",
  " After a few months I was able to see there would be a long journey but there is light at the end of the tunnel",
  " I kept it up and was able to work through a lot of the anxiety and the panic",
  " After almost a year I went looking for the state file of my story that was filed by the state social worker",
  " It ended up being a huge sadness because it was gone and there is no record of me ever meeting her",
  " I must have had some strength in me that I didn&#8217;t know about",
  " The day I found out the file was gone, I was at work and two friends were very supportive of me and helped me get through it",
  " I am still in awe of myself that I didn&#8217;t have a full on break down",
  " I realized at that point this is my story, I am living it at that moment",
  " I realized that my story does matter",
  " That I had a story that had twists and turns that I never thought it would have",
  "  A few months later I found out about a retreat for survivors that I was really interested in",
  " I applied to go, was accepted",
  " I went a few months later and so glad I did",
  " I told my family the night before I flew out",
  " I was so nervous telling them but once I did that, I felt that my journey was complete",
  " The week at the retreat flew by",
  " I meet a great group of other survivors, something that I never thought I would have meant",
  " Six months later I went to visit two of the girls I meant at the retreat",
  " I never imagine I would friends who are survivors",
  " The connections mean a lot to me",
  " I felt that I was understood without the need to explain myself",
  " I felt part of a group",
  " Through it all I am amazed that I survived as much as I have",
  " I thought I would never speak of what happened to me",
  " I thought it would go to the grave with me",
  " Once I told my family I felt free, and the shame lessen",
  " I learned that what matters the most is what I feel, what I think, not others",
  " It&#8217;s my story, and my story to tell",
  " I can tell it how I want to, when I want to",
  " I still have times when I am not sure if I am doing the right thing, yet I know in the end it&#8217;s my decision",
  " My story will continue on, how I want it to",
  " I feel secure when I need to I can call my therapist and get an appointment",
  " I know there is no shame in doing so and I am so happy that I feel comfortable about doing so",
  " Even though I have switched jobs, my supervisor is still a great friend and I know I can count on her through life&#8217;s ups and downs",

  "When you&#8217;re young you have your whole life ahead of you and it is only you that decides what your future will hold",
  "  All you have is school, your family and your friends",
  " You don&#8217;t expect your life to change when you&#8217;re only 15",
  " But if it does change, you&#8217;re certainly not ready",
  " You don&#8217;t see where you&#8217;ll end up three years down the line",
  " You focus on the present",
  " But even then, you could be blinded by the present, unable to see what is unravelling before you",
  " Something what you thought was amazing, your everything, could be destroying you from the inside out",
  "  If only we could tell our younger selves, warn ourselves about what was to come",
  "  Tell them that this big, new and exciting change isn&#8217;t necessarily going to be a good change",
  " Far from it",
  "  I wish I could have told myself that",
  " Growing up I was surrounded by fairy tales, once upon a times and happily ever after\u2019s&#8230; and even at a young adolescent age I longed for just that",
  " For someone to be my prince charming",
  " And at fifteen I got just that",
  " He was perfect, my first love, my everything",
  " No, my only thing",
  " Thinking back, I don&#8217;t know whether it was love or an infatuation, but at the time I believed it was love and that he loved me",
  " The belief that he loved me in return is why it took me so long to realise what was going on",
  " It was the reason I let him get away with everything",
  " Arguing is ok because at the end of the day, I believe he loves me",
  " Its ok for him to call me names and insult me, because at the end of the day I believe he loves me",
  "Its ok for him to destroy all my other relationships with my family and friends because at the end of the day, I believe he loves me",
  " He was a master of manipulation",
  " He made me feel as though my existence would be meaningless without him, and at one point I believed I wouldn&#8217;t be able to live without him",
  " That&#8217;s when he knew he had me tied up in his little web of deceit",
  " When he threatened to leave me and I begged him to stay, crying out saying that I promise I would make him happy&#8230; That I would do anything to make him happy",
  " Because that&#8217;s what you do right",
  " You want to make the person you love most in the world happy",
  " He didn&#8217;t just threaten to leave me once",
  " I didn&#8217;t just beg for forgiveness once, not that I did anything in need of forgiveness",
  " But he made me feel as though I was the cause of it all",
  " Over a two-and-a-half-year period, this happened hundreds, if not thousands of times",
  " And each time it happened I lost a little bit of myself",
  " He took my dignity, my self-respect and my confidence and left behind a shattered, broken shell of a girl",
  " Each time it happened I felt heartache all over again",
  " I didn\u2019t know my heart could be broken so many times by the same person",
  " But it was ok, because I believed he loved me",
  "My family saw this happening, my friends saw it and they all said how he wasn&#8217;t good for me",
  " I didn&#8217;t listen to them",
  " Why",
  " Because I believed he loved me",
  " He says he loves me so everything will be fine, I\u2019m loved by someone",
  " And that was a feeling I craved and wanted more than anything",
  " However, I escaped",
  " I\u2019m calling it my escape because that is how it felt",
  " A weight off my shoulder, free from a prison I had no idea I was in",
  " And eventually I, very slowly, came around to my senses about the situation",
  "My friends were all turning eighteen and started going out to clubs, a very normal thing to do when you reach this milestone age",
  " I never saw the appeal of it all until I started to feel left out, wanting to know what they meant and experience it",
  " He wasn\u2019t on board",
  " He felt like I was doing it just to fit in and be like everyone else, saying this wasn\u2019t the girl he fell in love with",
  " He accused me of cheating and/or being too interested in other guys; which was ridiculous",
  " Because he was my everything",
  " Nevertheless, I did go out on my eighteenth birthday",
  " It was an experience I needed",
  " I did get attention from other guys but I knew I was loyal, even if he didn\u2019t",
  "But that attention was unlike what I had previously experienced",
  " See, he had a way of making me feel as though, if it wasn\u2019t for him no one would love me, or find me attractive or be interested in me",
  " As if he was doing me a favor that I was his",
  " When I got home, I messaged to update him on my night",
  " That I really enjoyed and it was a good change",
  " I didn\u2019t get a reply",
  " Shouldn\u2019t he be happy that I enjoyed",
  " That\u2019s something I noticed about him, when he didn\u2019t like something I said or did he would just go radio silent",
  " At first it would drive me to insanity, fearing he would come back and say \u201cNo, you\u2019re not good enough, that\u2019s it",
  "\u201d But by then, it just made me think that this lack of communication is childish",
  " If something is wrong, then surly you should speak about it",
  " You should trust your significant other in scenarios like this",
  "This was the first red flag I had seen clear as day",
  " I was changing, I was becoming aware of every little flicker of a red flag",
  " Even though they had been waving right before me the entire time",
  " I was becoming fed up of him always making me feel like I\u2019m the bad guy about everything I did or said",
  " And I was starting to question whether this was \u201clove\u201d, because when you\u2019re in love you are supposed to be happy",
  " You aren\u2019t supposed to be crying yourself to sleep every night, you aren\u2019t supposed to feel worthless in a relationship and you aren\u2019t supposed to let your partner control you",
  " The next thing is what drew the line for me",
  " We had a brief spell where there were no arguments and things seemed to have been getting better, when I received a message off him saying \u201cI have something to say",
  "\u201d Now in my head although I didn\u2019t really want to break up, I hoped that this would be an excuse of his to say its over and then this time I won\u2019t plead with him",
  " I was nearly there, nearly strong enough to break free, to walk away from him",
  " I just needed him to start it off",
  "\u201cI hooked up with someone",
  "\u201d\u2026\u201cBut its ok because it made me realize how much I love you, and don\u2019t want to be with anyone else",
  "\u201dFor a couple of weeks, I was numb",
  " I didn\u2019t know what to say or do, I didn\u2019t fight or kick off at him, I went through everything",
  " Right from the beginning",
  " And the conclusion",
  " To get out of this toxic relationship",
  "Whatever lies and deceit I was being told to make me believe and reassure myself that he loved me were no match for this",
  " This is a well-known fact; if you love someone, you do not cheat",
  " You do not knowingly hurt them",
  "So, when I saw the opportunity, I did what I thought I would never have the courage to do",
  " And I was surprised by his reaction",
  " There wasn\u2019t a big argument, all he said was that \u201cI have given up on the relationship\u201d",
  " Which was true in one way, but I knew despite whatever he said, it was not my fault",
  " It was his, and he was the one to give me that well needed push to be able to go through with a break up",
  "A soon as it ended",
  " I automatically felt better; like a weight off of my shoulders, like the darkness was finally clearing a little",
  " I didn\u2019t cry",
  " But just because I didn\u2019t cry, it doesn\u2019t mean that I was ok",
  "That relationship left me broken",
  " I didn\u2019t know who I was, who I was meant to be and what I was meant to do",
  " I couldn\u2019t let anyone in, for fear of being hurt",
  " But our emotions are what makes us, us",
  " I tried being heartless, I tried not caring and for a while it worked",
  " I didn\u2019t want to become attached to anyone just in case I was hurt again",
  " I didn\u2019t want them to have that power over me",
  " Because I was finally in control over every aspect of my life",
  " But then being that way is lonely and I ended up believing that I needed to be in a relationship again",
  " I was envious of all the happy couples and resented them at the same time",
  " Why couldn\u2019t that be me",
  " What did I do to deserve this",
  " So I tried too hard and threw myself too much into the dating pool",
  " Just hoping something will magically happen",
  " And I realize now that I wasn\u2019t giving guys a chance because I was too picky and looking for perfection",
  " But the main reason",
  " I just wasn\u2019t ready to commit and open myself up to someone",
  "Hand on heart I thought I would get over it quicker than what I did",
  " I got over him no problem because he was toxic\u2026 but the mental scars took a while to heal, they\u2019re still healing",
  "It\u2019s funny because at the time I thought I was ok, I made out like I was handling everything",
  " But looking back, I didn\u2019t handle it well at all",
  " After the break up I went to clubs multiple times a week because I needed a distraction from the way I was feeling",
  " A distraction in the form of alcohol, dancing and guys",
  " I bottled everything up in order to show everyone I\u2019m ok and that I wasn\u2019t fragile",
  " I didn\u2019t want to be fragile, but I was",
  "The truth is, while writing this its the first time I\u2019ve processed everything",
  " Because, finally, I can say I\u2019m ok",
  " I wish I had spoken out about everything, to unload some of it because keeping it in wasn\u2019t healthy",
  " But I guess because it\u2019s taken so long to get here, it meant I found who I was",
  " I know who I am, and I am far from that little girl who believed in her first love, and I\u2019m not that lost, broken girl either",
  " I\u2019m head-strong with a heart of gold that cares too deeply than I\u2019d like to admit",
  " I\u2019m smart and stubborn and comfortable in my own skin",
  " I started to love myself and my life again",
  " I stopped thinking that I will never find someone, because I know eventually I will",
  "I pray that anyone who has been in a situation remotely the same as me take the following advice",
  " Quit overthinking, replaying scenarios that are long in the past, feeding self-doubt and believing you are worthless",
  " You deserve more than that",
  " Don\u2019t be the victim they made you into, be a warrior",
  "You will find someone, it will happen for you",
  " You spend months heartbroken over someone, thinking someone will never love you again, or that you will never love again",
  " But one day, when you least expect it, you\u2019ll meet someone",
  " And they\u2019ll make you believe in fairy tales and ever afters and they\u2019ll make you question whether it was even love in the first place",
  " Because what you are experiencing now, is unlike anything you are used to",
  " It doesn\u2019t have to happen straight away, it can happen years from now or maybe next Tuesday",
  " So, live in the present again, enjoy being single",
  " It wont last forever",
  " It took me a while to believe in myself again, but you must remember and trust that there is a future waiting for you, beyond what you might be able to grasp at this precise moment",
  " I am capable of great things, and I deserve happiness",

  " So when I was fourteen years old my dad died my mom started to flirt with a guy named Brian",
  " When I was fourteen I was one of the most beautiful people, so when Brian came over I had to go outside",
  " One day Brian came over and my screamed at me saying GO OUTSIDE",
  "",
  "",
  " So obviously I went outside",
  " But a couple minutes after it started to rain so I went inside I tried to explain to my mom but she didn&#8217;t listen and she screamed go to the adoption center",
  "",
  "",
  " So I went",
  " But at the time I didn&#8217;t have any friends so I got bullied allot",
  " After a couple month I made a friend her name was Emma we went to the same school",
  " Week&#8217;s after I got my first boyfriend his name was Jason and he was so rude I don&#8217;t know why I didn&#8217;t break up with him sooner but I didn&#8217;t",
  " One day me and Jason went to visit my mom and he started to flirt with her I snapped at him and screamed at him saying what, I&#8217;m braking up with you",

  "&#8221;  This Norman Rockwellish  southern bedtime ritual anticipates the cooing of a mother&#8217;s warm kiss upon her son\u2019s sweaty brow in the hot, still bedroom of their tiny mill-provided house as the lad\u2019s eyes grow heavy",
  " One final slip of the Robin Roberts baseball glove from under the fresh, sunshine drenched pillow and \u201csock it in the sweet spot\u201d one last time for the day",
  " This becomes a ritual akin to pulling the trigger for the final windup in the bottom of the ninth",
  " The punch brings up a mist of red infield dirt and the unmistakably heady smell of quality McGregor leather",
  "  &#8220;Georgia, Georgia&#8221;Mother, pecan pie, hoe cakes, steaming buttered biscuits and sorghum syrup, a slab of &#8220;streak o lean,&#8221; blistering hot summer days, homemade peach ice cream, short pants around the house, knee-patched long pants for town, Atlanta Crackers ball cap worn cocked slightly right, and choosing sides for morning baseball using the  &#8220;tossing the bat&#8221; method were as routine as attending prayer meetings on Wednesday",
  " This was my life in a special southern cotton-mill town in the 1950&#8217;s",
  " &#8220;Don&#8217;t It Make You Wanna Go Home&#8221;Growing up in the south was an earned privilege, a pay forward to the next generation by descendants mostly of mixed Scotch, Irish, English, Blacks, and Native Americans",
  "  We inherited much, perhaps not an inheritance of material possessions but we were beneficiaries of possessions money cannot buy: a high place earned through labor by antecedents dedicating themselves to sacrifice, and back-breaking hard work for the endowment of future heirs",
  "  We&#8217;re generations who\u2019ve been steeped in common-sense values and from this standpoint we survey the world and its offerings through a Protestant clarity",
  " &#8220;Lean On Me&#8221; Racial and religious bickering, territorial wars, cultural devastation of youth, drug abuse, social turmoil from unwelcome reform, religious and personal values decaying among us as time ticks ominously toward an early morning alarm, a media that exists merely to genuflect its own political bias",
  " Who do we trust, where can we turn, and to whom can we turn",
  " If we take the time to search longer and deeper into faces in the crowd we see a reflection back of our own fears",
  "  When we seek out other voices we hear our own cry echo back",
  "  When we reach out to feel the calluses of honest labor on our brothers&#8217; palms we acknowledge the collective labor of our antecedents",
  "  From the comfort of complacency, we see it all, the good, the bad, the lost, the found and the abandoned",
  " If you cannot save a soul, surely it\u2019d be noble to reach and try to help nourish a vanquished soul with humanity and understanding",
  "  Humility and humanity are easily nurtured; they always begin by just pausing to listen",
  " Mother chided often \u2018seek out and speak to a new soul every day and just listen to their life\u2019s ballad\u2019",
  "  She preached that every life is noble; she reflected the truth of every life basking in their finest hour and taught me that every man learns his greatest life lessons during his greatest trials",
  "  Mother always reminded me that everyone has something to teach you about who you are",
  " Mother Said \u201cLive and Let Live\u201dAmerica is proudly proclaimed a melting pot, a beautiful tapestry of color and culture",
  " Mother\u2019s &#8220;live and let live&#8221; philosophy encouraged an acceptance of all faiths, lifestyles, and cultures",
  " We were asked to leave our differences at the table after participating in vigorous debate, and finally we were encouraged to walk out of room speaking in one voice",
  " In the south, we\u2019ve struggled and flourished by living a doctrine of &#8220;right and duty:&#8221; Our abiding tenet is rooted in the notion that \u201cfor every right there is an equally weighted responsibility, and for every responsibility there is an equally weighted right",
  "\u201d This philosophy has kept us a civil society for the most part",
  "  &#8220;How Sweet the Sound&#8221;I\u2019d wager that my south wasn\u2019t unlike one\u2019s north",
  "  Mine was a close-knit small town Christian family which in all probability was akin to one\u2019s own close-knit large-city Jewish family",
  " My cotton mill working parents were hard working, God-fearing and honest as the day was long just as northern working parents were",
  " My America is their America",
  " We love life and we forever mourn those who&#8217;ve left us",
  " We fearlessly, proudly fight side by side; we willingly offer our lives to save each other but only when the cause is a just cause",
  " We\u2019re protective of the weakest among us just as surely as we abhor and defiantly reject the lazy",
  " We&#8217;re all aboard a roaring bullet train though perhaps on different tracks along with different stop preferences",
  " At the final destination some will be carried solemnly to the final rest stop, some will rush from the train and slide in the grave head first, full speed like Pete Rose stealing home",
  " The only certainty is that we&#8217;ll all get there, just in different ways and with different life stories flowing from our unique experiences",
  " &#8220;Weave Room Blues&#8221;A reprieve from the stultifying long hot summer days in the south for me included &#8220;cat fishing&#8221; with a cane pole, a bobber, a hook, and a worm harvested by bringing it to the surface with the vibration caused by rubbing a rock against a stake driven into the ground, or just finding a shady spot by the creek to munch on a bona fide, mayo relished, homemade pimento cheese sandwich on white bread",
  " Sometimes, we sipped on an RC Cola overflowing with generously salted peanuts and survived these &#8220;dog days",
  "&#8221;  A &#8220;moon pie&#8221; was always an extra special treat, which always seemed to be available only after mother &#8220;pulled a double&#8221; shift in the Weave Room at the mill",
  " &#8220;Put Your Hand In The Hand Of The Man Who Stilled The Water&#8221;Southern charity wasn\u2019t taught in the classroom, it\u2019s a demonstration of respect for life and fellow voyagers one comes into contact with throughout the business of life",
  " Who determines what the appropriate charitable reflex is when a child is drowning",
  " What remains to be thought about when addressing the indignity of a hungry child in America",
  "  What is there to contemplate when a child is sick, or when a child&#8217;s parents are abusive",
  " What is there to think about when a child implores you for compassion with desperate eyes and with hands outstretched for help in our bountiful country",
  " &#8220;That&#8217;s What Friends Are For&#8221;In my Southern America, if charity was sought, it was guaranteed",
  "  In my Southern America, it was never described as \u2018charity\u2019",
  "",
  "it was accepted as &#8220;doing what is right",
  "&#8221; In my childhood, no one asked for charity, but everyone was surrounded by it",
  " We never discussed sharing, we shared silently, and sought out those in need silently, we gifted anonymously",
  " Our charity in the south neither sought nor expected acknowledgement or overt gratitude",
  " Mother would cook far more food than our family needed so she could leave lots of extras in a secret place where the hungry knew where to seek and find her heart&#8217;s charity",
  " &#8220;Praise The Lord And Pass The  &#8220;Biscuits&#8221;Church was for sharing blessings &#8211; to sing, to laugh, to catch up with all that was happening around us, to rejoice in others&#8217; happiness, to contribute what we could for those in need",
  " I don&#8217;t recall the needy ever being the same people",
  " It&#8217;s as if the community&#8217;s help was all that was needed to ride out and turn a bad situation",
  " We were all brothers and sisters and addressed each other in this way",
  " I enjoyed being called &#8220;Brother Gary",
  "&#8221;  It made me feel big, part of something much bigger than I was",
  " My mother, &#8220;Sister Granger&#8221; taught us to be thankful for all we had, including each other",
  " Why God Only Gave Us One MotherMy mother was colorblind; she didn&#8217;t see color in faces, she responded only to honest and open hearts",
  " My mother was deaf; she didn&#8217;t hear harsh political speak, she kept her ears ready for spirited and heartwarming words of faith",
  " Mother was insensitive; she didn&#8217;t acknowledge the selfish, she merely advocated for the self reliant",
  " Mother didn&#8217;t feel pain, unless it was the pain of her children",
  " Mother wasn&#8217;t afraid of the dark even though she shunned the limelight",
  " Mother knew no strangers, only friends that she hadn&#8217;t met yet",
  " She belonged to everyone although we felt she was all ours",
  " My mother, and I\u2019m sure your mother, is the reason why God gave us only one mother&#8230;we couldn&#8217;t endure the loss of another",
  " And we couldn&#8217;t get through life without the beautiful memories she made happen",

  "A quick glance in her direction is his signal that all\u2019s ok; as proof, he determinedly chases fun-loving, boisterous Lucky with considerably more young-boy vigor; mother pauses, then stops &#8211; feet click together softly at faithful attention like the proud Marine her son would aspire to be",
  "The routine continues for a lifetime: a pervasive mental vision of the back door to the kitchen in the country house suddenly opening, its tired squeakiness drowned out by the shout of her boy as he rushes in from some distant place: \u201cMother, I made it &#8211; I\u2019m home",

  " Here, with Georgia red clay on his knees, kneeling to plant a flower in the rich, fertile soil while giving grace to God for allowing precious memories to be preserved; an appreciated smile to the heavens unhidden, red clay marks from the paws of a new youthful pup who is allowed to jump around and show love and emotion freely stripe down his vintage rock n roll t shirt, red clay between his toes from fishing on the river\u2019s bank &#8211; back where mother always wanted him &#8211; close by &#8211; close enough to drive and sit by her gravestone\u2026on clear Georgia days &#8211; days with a promise of a slight western breeze",
  " Gone so fast, back so slow &#8211; people all around here in the Georgia mountains watching nature\u2019s colorful signal that the curtain will soon close on this annual phase, but with the promise of a brilliant colorful encore &#8217;round the bend",

  " Mother was abused by my father for 15 years and I growing up in a home where violence was prevelant swore I would never be a victim",
  " However, as young as three years old I can remember being sexually abused by my half-brother",
  " When I told my parents they did not report it to the authorities but instead just sent my brother to live with a family member but later let him move back home",
  " I can remember this happening on 2 different occasions once when I was only 5 and again when I was thirteen",
  " When my mom let him move back home the last time I was only 13 and he was 25",
  " She put a lock on my door but it did not keep him from trying to walk in on me while I was getting dressed or from making lud comments to me",
  " When I was only 15 I met the man who would later become my husband; he was 21 and I was barely 16 when he took my virginity",
  " He seemed like prince charming and after only a few months promised to marry me one day",
  " He promised to protect me and keep me from my brother",
  " We dated on and off until I was 19 and then he moved away to Texas",
  " After breaking up with my fiance at 20 I contacted him and moved to Texas with him and his fiance",
  " He told me it would be strictly platonic but after I got there I found out him and his fiance were polyamorous and wanted me to be part of their relationship",
  " I was hesitant but agreed because he was my first love a d I never really got over him",
  " At age 22 I moved back to Indiana with him after his finance had an abortion and broke his heart",
  " He claimed he only wanted to marry her for duel citizenship in Italy",
  " I ignored all the read flags, made excuses for the abuse and married him at age 23",
  " I can remember at time when our children were only age 5 &amp; 6 were the Psychological and physical abuse were so bad that I was made to believed I was a bad mom and that the only way to stop the abuse was to let him kill me as he had attempted to do in the past when I&#8217;d tried to leave and take our children with me",
  " I was with my husband for 12 years and married for 10 before I finally got the courage and strength to leave",
  " I am now in the process of getting a protective order that includes our children and divorcing my husband",

  "Hi my name is Jules Let me give you some background information about me before I start this story",
  " I went to a Christian school",
  "I had some friends but not many",
  " This started when I was in fifth grade",
  " The boy who bullied me was two years older than me but we ate lunch at the same time",
  " We had this thing called after- care",
  " I was playing with a volleyball and going to a place where I could play in peace,when the bullie came up to me and PURPOSELY bumped into me",
  " Let\u2019s call him Chris",
  " Chris wasn\u2019t always nice with me",
  " He used to be nice to me when I was younger cause I guess he considered me as a baby or something",
  " When he bumped in to me he said \u201cGet out the way retard",
  "\u201d I was confused so I said you bumped into me",
  " He walked away and continued playing kickball with his friends",
  " Oh let me just say that my three ONLY friends were playing with him",
  " They told me that he was nice and he cared about me and if I got hurt he\u2019d help but that\u2019s not true at all",
  " Once I fell on the playground at recess and Chris came up to me \u201cdo you need some help\u201d he said he gave me his hand then boom he dropped me on the floor again",
  " That\u2019s when I started to avoid him",
  " His constant bullying went on and on until I convinced my mom to move me to a new school",
  " I have his brother\u2019s number and my old friends\u2019 so sometimes when we meet up he\u2019s there",
  " That was one year ago I\u2019m 11 now",
  " What did you think of my story",
  "",
  "Growing up was hard for me",
  " When a baby is born you don\u2019t except something wrong with it but for me it was different",
  " I was born hard of hearing and I hate it",
  " You see hard of hearing means you can\u2019t hear well",
  "",
  "So I had to get hearing aids",
  " My first ones were when I was just about a couple months old",
  " Of corse I didn\u2019t understand at the time but as I got older it was different",
  " You see I wasn\u2019t sad about it, I knew I was different but some times I wish I was \u201cnormal\u201d I wasn\u2019t bullied but there were some kids who were mean but I didn\u2019t care",
  " I hated to put my hair up because people will see my hearing aid and I didn\u2019t like it",
  " People aways treated my different because of my hearing loss and I felt weird about it",
  " I don\u2019t want to be treated different because of it",
  " But I\u2019m am 16 years old now and I realize that this is a gift",
  " Yes I may have trouble hearing but it doesn&#8217;t mean I\u2019m different, I can do things like other people can do",
  " So aways love your self for who you are and don\u2019t let anyone tell you that your different",

  "I\u2019ve been having dreams about my kids every night for the last few weeks",
  " They\u2019re college students in their twenties, but in my dreams, they\u2019re toddlers again",
  " In last nights dream I was vaguely protecting the toddler versions of them from grown people that they\u2019re involved with now, in their 20\u2019s",
  " During the dream I am aware that it\u2019s odd to have adults from their present life looming over them as toddlers, but in my dreams, worlds intersect and the past and the future are fluidly combined",
  " Last nights dream had me reading them their bedtime stories, while protecting their toddlers selves from their current adult perceived foes",
  " I wake up from these baby dreams feeling confused and mournful for a few hours as I wander through my early morning ritual of tea and breakfast, trying to shake the thick muzziness and feeling of loss from my head; trying to remember the elusive details of the dream until finally I capture the essence of it and well up with sadness until the caffeine in my tea eventually snaps me back to reality and shakes the melancholy out of me",
  " It wasn\u2019t until this morning when I saw a lot of back-to-school posts on Facebook that I realized that I was going through the same annual emotions I\u2019ve always experienced when the kids go back to school, even though they\u2019re now in college",
  " I miss them",
  " Simple as that",
  " They\u2019re grown up and I mourn the loss of their younger selves",
  " That\u2019s not to say I prefer their younger selves to who they are now",
  " I love them and am thrilled with who they\u2019ve become and what they\u2019re capable of and where their lives are headed",
  " But I miss the babies that have grown up and are no longer here",
  " I miss the physicality of infancy and toddlerhood; the hand-holding whenever we\u2019d go out, the daily snuggling, the night-time book reading, the bath time, the night-time hugs, the tear wiping, the snot nose wiping, the uproarious laughing, the excitement at learning to read, the laying in bed together when one of them couldn\u2019t sleep, the rituals, the chores, the constant picking up and carrying \u2013 all of it, I miss all of it",
  "I wish I\u2019d played with them more",
  " I wish I\u2019d appreciated it all while it was happening, as now I realize how quickly it all zoomed by",
  " It\u2019s like so many things in life, as Joni Mitchell said, \u201cDon\u2019t it always seem to go, that you don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve got \u2019til it\u2019s gone",
  "\u201d Back when they were toddlers, I was always so exhausted and overwhelmed",
  " Now that I\u2019m through it all, I can see what a remarkable time it was and how lucky I was to experience it and them, but during the actual years that they were young, I was so tired, scared and overwhelmed with work and raising two kids that I didn\u2019t appreciate it as much as I could have",
  " So if you\u2019re reading this and have young kids of your own, please try to recognize that it will all go by very quickly and you\u2019ll all be fine and at some point in your life, you\u2019ll have enough time to sleep again, so appreciate it now while they\u2019re young and impressionable",
  " As my therapist used to tell me, \u201cYou\u2019re just planting seeds, that\u2019s all you need to do right now, just plant the seeds",
  "\u201d I used to think she was batshit crazy as I was right in the thick of things and never thought they were even listening to a single word I said, but now that they\u2019re 21 and 23, I can see the beautiful, strong trees growing up from those seeds I planted years ago and it\u2019s kind of amazing that it really worked",

  "Losing someone is hard, it shatters you",
  " I remember as a child, I once cried for days when I lost my favourite toy",
  " As a teenager, I experienced my first heartbreak when I lost a relationship",
  " But I never considered &#8220;Death&#8221; as a means of separation",
  " I was too young for that",
  " I would think about death or losing someone to death when I&#8217;d look at my grandparents maybe",
  " Or an old couple walking down the street or while watching movies about cancer but it never felt real to me",
  "As an individual, I was untouched by death, I was untouched by pain, I was in my bubble",
  " Then one day, that bubble burst",
  " I lost my little brother &#8211; only 18 years of age to the one thing I never payed heed to",
  " Death is like a monster lurking within your closet, but that day it was standing right in front of me and I was frozen",
  " I was powerless",
  "I remember back in school, I promised myself that I would never cry, that crying was stupid",
  " I was wrong",
  " I cried alright, I cried for days",
  " I cried for my mum, I cried for my dad, I cried because Raghav was not around and I never got to say goodbye",

  " I decided to seek professional help because it was getting too much",
  " There was a point when I wanted to give up but that&#8217;s when my family swooped in to rescue me",
  "I&#8217;m on medication now and life&#8217;s bearable which is a good sign",
  " Death has somehow taught me a couple of lessons already",
  "It&#8217;s taught me that life is unpredictable and death is very real",
  " It&#8217;s important to stop planning things &#8211; because you don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to happen in the next 5 years or 2 years or a month or even a day from now",
  " It&#8217;s taught me that life&#8217;s too short to have regrets, we need to start prioritizing ourselves",
  "I have a newfound respect for myself and everything that I have",
  " I&#8217;ve been unfortunate in many ways, I&#8217;ve experienced my share of trauma and pain but I&#8217;ve grown from it",
  " And that&#8217;s what life is all about, growing",
  "Death has also taught me how important it is to never end a conversation with a fight because you never know if you&#8217;ll ever see that person again",
  " It&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve started practicing empathy, gratitude, spirituality and I know now that death is not the end at all",
  " I know for a fact that Raghav is still around, watching over me, helping me realise my purpose, pushing me forward",
  " I wouldn&#8217;t have made the decisions I made this year without his presence and strength",
  " I couldn&#8217;t have done it alone",
  " I&#8217;m now dedicated to work towards mental health",
  " Losing a loved one to suicide leaves you in pieces, I&#8217;m still gathering myself but helping those who are struggling just like my brother was, has healed me in ways I cannot explain",
  " I could have saved my brother if I&#8217;d known",
  " If only",
  " This feeling will never go away, it&#8217;s always there in the back of my head no matter how many people I&#8217;m able to help but it gets easier to live with it because I know that he&#8217;s not mad at me",
  " He doesn&#8217;t hate me for not understanding, for not being there for him when he needed me",
  " He only feels love now, he only feels peace",

  "  We shoved our own grief deep down, choosing to be strong for Mom and for each other",
  "  Or at least that is what I think we did and why we did it",
  "  But maybe not",
  "  Maybe the grief was too hard to face into",
  "  Maybe I pushed my grief away and focused all of my attention on Mom because that was somehow easier to do",

  "  I was determined to be strong, and to do that I put most of my grief \u201con hold",

  "\u2019\u201d  Three days later, she was ready",
  "When Mom died, our family grieved heavily",
  "  We grieved for her and we grieved for Dad, and we loved each other through the pain and loss and sadness that came with Mother\u2019s Day, Father\u2019s Day, and Mom and Dad\u2019s birthdays, both in June",
  "  We gratefully received the love and many expressions of sympathy and support from dear friends",
  "  Then we emptied and sold the home where Mom and Dad had lived for over sixty years, the home where they crossed from this life to the afterlife",
  "  And we cried through it all",
  " Just last week I thought I had cleared the last remnants of grief, but this morning I realized I was wrong",
  " Lightning struck again, sparked by a dream, and I felt the raw, jagged pain of missing my Dad",
  "  A week or a month from now, it is possible that some song, some dream, some something will spark a deep feeling of missing my Mom",
  "  What I am learning though all of this is that my usual way of dealing with things, my lists and schedules and careful planning, mean very little",
  "  Lightning strikes when it will",
  "  All I can do is promise to try to see the beauty of my grief, the proof that my love for my parents, and their love for me, is as strong as ever",
  "  And maybe even stronger",

  "Dedication: To everyone struggling to lose weight and be healthy in a society who does not make it easyMy Story of Overcoming ObesityI am strong and I am sucessful because I beat Obesity",
  " Obesity is an issue that is very present in America today; and for the lives that it does not claim, there is a dramatic impact forced upon them",
  " There are other terms that are harshly used in reference to the term obese, such as fat, ugly, gross, etc",
  " Oddly enough, the definition of obese is to be grossly fat or overweight",
  "  I am certain from experiences of my own there have been other terms, that are not so pleasant",
  " Obesity has played a very real and present role in my life\u2019s journey, from as early as my teenage years",
  "Society has given girls with curves a complex by saying the only way to perfection is to be runway model skinny; and How does a teenage girl or boy struggling with weight issues respond",
  " The response is given to society with teenagers turning to anorexia, bulimia, and sadly enough suicide",
  "As a teen I was 300 plus pounds; and even in adulthood, after having two children, I hit near the 400 pound mark",
  " I was not obese; I was morbidly obese, and I lived every day, while taking 5 or more insulin shots, that it might be my last",
  " I never felt like I would be anything other than the fat girl who had an amazing personality, which was a never-ending pursuit to make others smile and know their worth, while not realizing her own",
  "  Society told me I was fat, and I listened",
  " Medically I was told I would not live another ten years at the current health status I was in, and emotionally I was defeated without even trying to fight",
  "Society defines obesity as fat, the medical field defines obesity as an epidemic, and I define obesity as a mental prison",
  " This prison that holds your life captive and alters your mental, physical, and emotional state so much that it changes who you are as a human-being",
  " Society will make you a statistic, or a target to the marketing of the diet fads, and gossip material for talk show hosts",
  " I feel that it is so hard for so many obese people to change their health and lose weight",
  " There is so much information that can be misleading",
  " Weight loss programs inform you to spend large amounts of money with the promise of weight loss success, but fails to tell you that it is short term success",
  " When your weight returns and your money leaves, so does their support",
  "Why are people obese",
  " There is no simple answer, and not every answer is the same",
  " For me personally, I was dealing with uncontrolled insulin levels; and The more insulin I took; the more weight I gained",
  " I was too tired to exercise, and too hungry to not eat",
  " My sugars were too low and too high to maintain a steady diet, and though I had an abundance of support, I was too defeated to care",
  " I was fat and I would never be anything else",
  " The mind has a large role to factor in also, in terms of why are people obese",
  "  Mentally a person has to acknowledge there is an issue and create an action plan to resolve it",
  "The 400 pound woman that I was, decided that there was no magic pill, no gimmick, and no force on Earth that could take that weight off  without a lifestyle change, a healthy diet, and a plan of action, that would carry out all three",
  " I realized that as a diabetic I would research the Adkins diet, and found that while it was not the perfect solution for my weight loss needs",
  " It was a platform to begin my weight loss journey",
  " I lost 260 pounds",
  " I came off insulin shots completely",
  " I now weigh 155 pounds",
  " My journey is not over",
  " I have won the physical battle; but many who has fought obesity, claim that the mental battle then starts",
  " Accepting that you succeeding and seeing the results in the mirror are very hard for many, especially those who were subject to the cruel words of others",
  "There is most certainly an epidemic in America today with obesity, and there is a solution; but With any problem in life, there has to be a will to make a way",
  " The solution for me was to fight for my life and live for my kids, and in order to stay motivated, I looked to them, NOT to society",
  " I also had to realize that my children would follow in my footsteps, and I needed to teach them to be healthy, not to be skinny or what society says is right",
  " The key to success with weight loss, begins with the person willing to find their motivation and fight for it",
  "Society does not make beating obesity easy",
  " Society\u2019s pressure on men as well as women to be perfect has created a path for eating disorders, depression, social isolation, etc",
  " These issues can be just as deadly as obesity; This proving true for my 37-year-old cousin this past year, losing her battle with anorexia and bulimia",
  " Society called her fat in high school, so she started a path of not eating, throwing up every bite of food she ate, taking laxatives, creating a war within her body and her mind",
  " My cousin, by the name of Heather Austin, lost her life trying to be accepted by society",
  "The answer to obesity is not losing weight for love or acceptance",
  " The answer to obesity is working hard to achieve a healthy body, so that you can live a long life with the ones who already love and accept you for the individual that you are",
  "  Obesity is a deadly force, but one that can be fought; and It is a battle we can be won through education and support in place of criticism and mocking",
  "There is a bias towards obese people, just as there is a bias towards addiction, because it is easier to judge rather than to understand",
  " Everyone knows someone who is obese, just as everyone knows a substance abuse addict, but do they know what caused this addiction",
  " Many obese individuals suffer from food addiction, to no fault of their own",
  " Many addicts are so because of a situation in life, leading them to an addiction more powerful than them",
  " The first step is finding help, finding support, and starting the journey to take control of your life",
  " I am learning and encouraging others to do the same",

  "Trigger warning: Please be aware that this story includes a graphic description of childhood FGM (Female Genital Mutilation)",
  "This was one chilly afternoon in the month of November in the year 1996",
  " I vividly recall this afternoon of Saturday my parents asked us (my twin brother and I) to prepare ourselves for an afternoon drive",
  " This to me sounded unusual owing to the fact that the weather was not very favorable to leave the house",
  " I  curiously asked my mum where we were going and she just smiled and hurriedly asked me to quickly dress, and suggested we would get late",
  " We got into the car and my dad drove off, my brother and I kept peeping out of the window just to get a clue of the place we were headed but it seemed impossible to even guess",
  " However, we got to a small village with scattered houses similar to a rural setting with very few people inhabiting it",
  " We were welcomed by an old lady who from my judgment was the age of my grandmother my mum held my hand and asked me to follow her to the old lady&#8217;s house",
  " Meanwhile, my dad and brother left, I could hear my mum telling my dad that it would take less than 20mins, so they would come to pick us up",
  "The old lady then asked me to lie down on the floor where she had spread apiece of cloth",
  " I tried to resist and looked at my mum panicking and she encouraged me to comply",
  " I did so hesitantly not knowing what was awaiting, She then asked me to relax pull my dress up and open my legs apart, as I tried to resist and cry my mum held my hands and I saw the old lady pick something that looked like a penknife and proceeded she cut off the clitoris",
  " te pain was soo excruciating and unbearable",
  "she then numbed the place with some methylated spirit and stitched it",
  " I tried to persevere and not to cry as my mum held me",
  " Sooner than later my dad and brother arrived to pick us, I realized my brother had also been circumcised, he was in equal pain as me, but for him, it was &#8220;medicalization&#8221;",
  "I felt betrayed by my parents, having gone through this terrible experience, that would later have consequences on me",
  " However i forgave them",
  "We got home and found that a separate house had been set aside for us to stay through the &#8220;healing process&#8221; this would take 3-4 weeks and traditionally each of us was assigned an elder sister and brother to educate us on matters of reproductive health",
  " The isolation would include minimal interaction with neighbors and even close family friends",
  " on the last day, a ceremony was organized for us to appreciate and symbolize our transition to teenage",
  "First forward, I fell into depression in 2009 and even attempted suicide but luckily I survived",
  " I never knew that the experiences I had been going through earlier in life were taking a toll on me, even more worse I isolated myself from people and later discovered I was suffering from social anxiety disorder(SAD)",
  " I went through counseling combined with cognitive behavioral therapy",
  "I felt the need to begin a movement targeting young girls from age 11-25 years training them on the need to know their bodies and to identify the threats that they may encounter in the day to day life and how to overcome them",

  "Dedication: To anyone who feels like they should give upKnow That I wrote this because if I keep bottling everything inside me I\u2019ll burst",
  " So I guess this is a rant that is somewhat depressing",
  " But I\u2019d rather let it out with the hope that I will finally be able to talk about it instead of hiding and destroying myself from the inside out because of the walls I\u2019ve built around my heart",
  " With that said here\u2019s my story: Overwhelming",
  " Confusing",
  " And exhausting are really the only words I can describe everything between August 23, 2018 &#8211; Present",
  " My first surgery was Aug",
  " 23rd And was worse than anything I could ever imagine",
  " I got it because I had kidney stones",
  " I remember after my surgery me crying in pain, as I tried to go to the restroom at a filthy gas station, when all I wanted to do was sleep",
  " For a reference I never cry or scream with kidney stones, I sing",
  " Singing is my happy place or my refuge",
  " It\u2019s the only thing keeping me sane",
  " Without music, I\u2019d lose my mind",
  " Anyways, later I had gone to CVS to use the bathroom again and literally started screaming and repeatedly crying, \u201cI can\u2019t I can\u2019t I cant I can\u2019t I can\u2019t do this again it hurts to much",
  "\u201d Because I had so many in both kidneys, they had to get them out through surgery",
  " But it swelled up and I had to not only have stents in for a month and a half, but I had to get a second surgery",
  " The pain was worse than I could ever imagine it being",
  " Not only physically but mentally as well",
  " I stopped eating, sleeping, and talking",
  " I became a stranger in my own body",
  " 1st week I came back and I had a mental break down because of the seemingly endless amount of medications I was on to help ease the pain",
  " The side effects caused me to think something was wrong with me and my nose when in reality my nose was sore from the scratching I had done and the blood I had acaused",
  " I also started  mhhaving panic attacks and anxiety to the point where I\u2019d stay up, even if I was exhausted, till 5 am because of fear",
  " I had felt as if I was a nuisance to my friends and to everyone because I would come to them crying at least once a week",
  " Despite there attempt to make me smile, I didn\u2019t need someone to comfort me or help me",
  " I just needed someone who was physically there because I can\u2019t talk about it to myself",
  " I need someone there",
  " They don\u2019t even need to listen they can just sit there and give an occasional nod",
  " Another thing is ya know what I hate",
  " ya When people say \u201cI understand\u201d because they don\u2019t understand",
  " I don\u2019t even understand",
  " How can someone understand how I feel when I don\u2019t even know how I feel or who I am anymore",
  " Worst part is I lost a few good friends who tried to help me so much but couldn\u2019t take my negativity anymore which I understand",
  " If any of them, Red etc",
  " are reading this: thank you for all you did",
  " I hope you still view me in a positive light",
  " And that if I\u2019m still here for you even if you think we\u2019re enemies I\u2019ll still be here for you my old friends",
  " Anyways, the next surgery rolls up and I was more scared then I had ever been in my life",
  " I couldn\u2019t stop panicking and crying because i didn\u2019t want to relive this pain over and over again",
  " I couldn\u2019t handle not even being able to speak to anyone without getting side track or starting to cry because my words would fill up with a flood of pain that I tried to hold in but it will never be fully released no matter how many times I cry",
  " The events, though may seem small and dumb, but in my mind have left me traumatized and you can\u2019t just \u201cget better\u201d when your traumatized",
  " I can\u2019t explain it to people because all they see is a broken girl who had a hard surgery and is going through a lot but is being over dramatic and wants attention and now is acting strange because she forgot how to smile and stay positive",
  " But how I see it is a broken girl who is trying so hard to be okay",
  " She is trying so hard to reach out and get help because she will remember everything that has happened",
  " She realizes not only is she different but she has messed up every single thing in her life",
  " She feels like she is going in sane yet she can\u2019t tell anyone in the moment because in the moment she doesn\u2019t know",
  " And she is told to stay positive and be yourself, but how can you be yourself when you\u2019ve lost everything in you",
  " How can you stay positive when you feel trapped inside a room that reminds you of every single pain you\u2019ve ever had",
  " That\u2019s what the broken girl sees",
  " What\u2019s funny is she is kinder on her darkest days",
  " The kinder she seems the worse her day has been",
  " I think she does this because maybe if she\u2019s kind maybe someone will talk to her when she\u2019s alone",
  " But she makes herself alone, she did it too herself",
  " She is sitting alone at lunch while her friends are laughing with each other at another table",
  " Maybe it\u2019s because she\u2019d rather feel alone than lonely in a crowded room",
  " Because lonely and alone mean two different things",
  " Alone is being antisocial, you\u2019re somewhat okay and just rather be by yourself and relax",
  " Lonely is when you feel as if no one cares and as if no one would notice you were gone like usual",
  " It makes you feel numb and broken",
  " Being in a group of people makes it worse as well because you can\u2019t hold a conversation neither can they",
  " It\u2019s just small talk at this point",
  " That\u2019s the difference",
  " And it\u2019s a gamble everyday on how much I will block out and how much I\u2019ll act positive and lie to myself saying I\u2019m okay when in reality I\u2019m falling deeper into an agonizing hole with a darkness that consumes you",
  " I don\u2019t mean to be rude to anyone but why must people say \u201cyour overthinking\u201d or \u201cyour being dramatic\u201d because I work harder than it seems to stop this toxic habit of mine",
  " Heck I\u2019ve done so much to stop my fear of pain and what\u2019ll happen next",
  " It\u2019s my flaw and people pointing it out makes me feel bad",
  " Anyways back to topic, after my second surgery I was so happy to go days without pain",
  " I had forgotten what having no physical pain felt like",
  " In fact I think that was the happiest part, know it was done and that I could finally cry tears of joy and relief because the lord had finally healed me",
  " Sadly as u read, the Joy only lasted a few days",
  " I didn\u2019t want to tell anyone I was in pain mentally because I said they didn\u2019t have to deal with my rants anymore",
  " They shouldn\u2019t have to carry my pains when they have their own",
  " I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being selfish for talking about it and I don\u2019t want to know either",
  " But if your in pain remember your not alone because that is a hard feeling to stop",
  " Next, though there\u2019s not much to be said, is I stopped eating and sleeping though I am getting better at it, but I still don\u2019t eat anything all day or do an all nighter from time to time",
  " But I haven\u2019t in a while",
  " Maybe I am truly progressing",
  " And maybe I am being dramatic but can you blame me",
  " For I am a child who walked into situation with hope and came out with little hope and a lost identity",
  " By December I was a wreck",
  " I have anxiety panic attacks ADHD and to top it all off, depression",
  " Isn\u2019t that ironic",
  " The girl who hands out candy to people to make them smile or the girl who I usually optimistic has depression",
  " But ya I was diagnosed with depression",
  " For me depression is a numb feeling at 3 am and I can\u2019t cry because I have no tears left to cry",
  " All I can do is blankly Stare as I watch my world crumble into nothing but rubble ashes and cinders",
  " By January 2019, I basically went silent in a way",
  " I couldn\u2019t even rant in my journals",
  " My panic attacks got more frequent but less intense",
  " Either that or I\u2019m able to catch them before they get out of hand",
  " My anxiety has worsened, especially at night",
  " I\u2019ll feel as if something is going to kill me if I close my eyes or if I look away from the dark corner",
  " I\u2019ll stay up till 3-4 am being afraid of nothing yet everything at the same time",
  " I know I\u2019m afraid of the monsters I created in my head but I don\u2019t know how to destroy them",
  " I think part of me is hoping this\u2019ll help",
  " This being sharing what I\u2019ve written in my journal",
  " Sharing what I\u2019ve bottled up for months now, I think finally coming out will make it easier to handle",
  " Another thing is I hate being touched (which is ironically funny because I\u2019m a hugger)",
  " I think this is because I so afraid of being in pain that I feel as if anyone and everyone will hurt me even if they just barely touch me",
  " I know they won\u2019t hurt me but I can\u2019t take chances anymore",
  " I won\u2019t let myself be in so much pain again",
  " I can\u2019t let myself be in so much pain again",
  " Too others I may seem like I am overreacting or wanting attention",
  " I\u2019m not",
  " I\u2019m reacting to a situation that broke me",
  " I am not saying I don\u2019t have hope because I do have hope",
  " I know my story could possibly change someone\u2019s life one day and give them the hope that was lost in a sea of darkness and despair",
  " Even if I am broken I will always have hope",
  " And I do have hope, even though I still have bad days, I have come so far and am so proud of myself for everything I went through",
  " And remember no matter how much pain your in, never give up",
  " Keep going",
  " Because one day your story will save a life",
  " I thank those who actually read this whole thing even if u didn\u2019t I get why",

  " Which by the way I didn\u2019t take the news so well and I just cry and wounder why my health is just keep getting bad",

  " It was crippling and terrifying",
  " I could barely breath, I was hyperventilating, and I was sweating all over",
  " Let me start at the beginning",
  " So it all started when I got sick",
  " I was out of school for about a week",
  " Now, I&#8217;m a perfectionist, I always have been, so when I received a boat load of homework, I was really overwhelmed",
  " It got to the point that whenever I received a new homework assignment I would have a mini panic attack",
  " Over time, these panic attacks got worse and worse",
  " I was having a panic attack on average 2-3 times per day when I was at school (though they ranged in severity)",
  " I would have to go down to the counselors office so much, that they actually gave me a special pass",
  " All I had to do was flash the pass at my teacher and I could just go down without even having to say anything to the teacher",
  " I started to hear voices telling me things like, &#8220;Your so stupid,&#8221; and &#8220;Your disgusting",
  "&#8221; This only added to my anxiety, which then caused an onset of depression",
  " I was so depressed, I didn&#8217;t want to get out of bed in the morning",
  " I was exhausted all of the time",
  " The voices steadily grew worse",
  " &#8220;Hurt yourself,&#8221; they would say, &#8220;It will make you feel better",
  "&#8221; I barley smiled or laughed",
  " But through all of that time I told no one what I was truly feeling",
  " No one",
  " Not even my parents or my best friend",
  " I just kept all of my suffering locked up inside my mind",
  " That is one of my biggest regrets",
  " I still remember when one day I was walking down the halls and I passed by the bathroom",
  " I had just had another panic attack but instead of walking to the counselors office, I ran into the bathroom",
  " I exploded",
  " I threw my bag against the wall, my stuff going everywhere, and I screamed",
  " I screamed and cried, and cried some more",
  " I threw my hands against the walls and pounded them",
  " I was so mad and upset that this was happening to me",
  " I had no clue why this was happing, and I also couldn&#8217;t put what was happing to me into words",
  " Finally when i was done screaming, I slowly walked up to the mirror and looked at myself dead in the eye and, I&#8217;ll never forget what I said to myself, I said, &#8220;I hate you",
  "&#8221;and I meant it",
  " That is what I think was one of the moments that sent me spiraling down a long, hard road to recovery",
  " I think that one of the saddest parts of that day was that no one heard my screams",
  "It was just another school day in November when I decided that that day I would end it all",
  " In my last class before lunch, I showed my teacher my pass and he said that I could go",
  " I left the classroom",
  " I waited until nobody was  looking an then I left the building",
  " I ended up walking to an overpass, pedestrian bridge over a highway about a mile from my school",
  " Once on the bridge I wrote a suicide note and climbed over the fence-ready to jump",
  " Every part of me wanted to jump, but I didn&#8217;t",
  " Now I know that was God",
  " Shortly after I climbed the fence, a police officer came and asked me what I was doing",
  " I responded that I wanted to die",
  " He talked into his radio and a bunch of police officer&#8217;s came, along with an ambulance and a fire truck",
  " They ended up closing the highway below and two semi-truck drivers parked under the bridge so if I fell, I wouldn&#8217;t fall far",
  " I never got the chance to meet them and thank them, but I&#8217;m forever grateful for what they did",
  " One officer in particular was able to talk me out of taking my life, and he stayed with me the entire time, hanging onto a loop of my jeans so I didn&#8217;t fall",
  " The only time that he left my side was when I rode down to safety in the bucket of the fire truck",
  " He is one of the heroes of my story",
  " I was brought by ambulance to the hospital",
  " During my hospital stay I was diagnosed with severe depression and generalized anxiety disorder",
  " I ended up having 4 inpatient hospital stays over the following months",
  " Some of my hospital stays and struggles were from prescribed medications that my body reacted negatively to",
  " It took awhile to find the correct medications and doses",
  " During my 2nd hospital stay, which was due to a med reaction, I started self-harming almost daily",
  " Self-harm became a big monster that ended up being very hard to overcome",
  " Although I was never diagnosed, in the end I suffered from PTSD from all of the trauma and pain I had during my year of 13",

  " Yeah I thought I was a dreaming, until I came to realize it was reality, reality that I really was away from my mom and dad",

  " Why did I have to get taken away",
  " Why couldn&#8217;t it be any other child",
  "&#8221; I never understood why",
  " So growing up I always felt something was missing",

  "These are the words that come to my mind when I think about my mom",
  " Raising two little girls in a single-parent household was not always easy for her, but she never let anything get in the way of being the best mom, the best example, and the best hero that she could be",
  "\u00a0It is very important to dismiss and clear the stigmas single-mothers face within society and actually take the time to perceive and listen to their struggles",
  " Being more open minded will give us a better understanding of their lives and what they go through, rather than judging prior to knowing their stories",
  " Many people stigmatize these individuals as women who simply want to take advantage of the very limited resources they are being provided; however, those critics fail to realize the immense strength and power our single moms hold",
  " After all, they are taking on the role of two people, which is not always easy",
  "\u00a0Growing up in a single-parent household myself, I saw my mom struggle in different ways, however, that did not mean she was any less of a mom or didn\u2019t provide for my sister and I in the ways she was supposed to",
  " Because my mom worked so much and my sister and I were involved in many sports growing up, she would hardly have time for herself because she was always driving us back and forth to our different activities",
  " I remember specifically when we were around 9-years old, my sister and I were involved in swim and soccer",
  " My mom would wake up early to make breakfast and lunch, take us to school, go to work, and as soon as she got off work she would rush to pick us up from school",
  " We would have back-to-back practices, rushing to soccer practice after swim",
  "I remember how tired she used to be at the end of the day",
  " She would wake up around 5:30 a",
  "m",
  " and wouldn\u2019t be home until around 8:00 or 9:00 pm",
  " She never once complained",
  " My mom gave, and continues to give, my sister and I all that she can, even if it means having fewer things for herself",
  " She would rather buy us everything we needed for our extra curricular activities, new clothes for school, take us on movie dates on the weekend, etc",
  " than spend a dime on herself",
  " For this reason, and many others, my mom is my hero",
  "\u00a0Although making up 23 percent of all households in the nation, single-mother households receive no broader societal support and must work 10 times harder for the things that they want and need",
  " They must fight hard for the survival of their family with a single source of income to provide for the entire family\u2019s needs",
  " This can be more challenging for many women due to the gender wage gap",
  " Regardless of whether you are rich, poor, or middle class, problems and obstacles can and will arise and these moms are expected to find ways to singlehandedly overcome them",
  " Struggles may include working long hours, feeling isolated and alone, making crucial decisions on your own, being constantly tired, and experiencing stress and anxiety",
  " These women must face the struggle of people judging them, believing many of the single-mother stereotypes",
  "My mom has been the best example of what a mom truly is: someone who loves you unconditionally, protects you, helps you, and wants the best for you",
  " According to statistics, 70 percent of Americans believe that single moms have a negative influence on society",
  " However, my mom is far from being a \u201cnegative influence\u201d on anyone",
  " She came to the United States at the age of 16, knowing very little English",
  " After getting situated in a new country, she began working and has been working ever since",
  " Having worked as a playground aide for more than 10 years at an elementary school, she has touched many hearts and has inspired others to always work hard while remaining humble",
  "\u00a0When I was younger, I used to volunteer at my mom\u2019s school while I was on holiday or school breaks",
  " Speaking to the young children, as well as some teachers, I learned that my mom, as I expected, was very well-respected and everyone spoke very highly of her",
  " This reassured me that not only was my mom positively impacting my life, but also the lives of all the young children around her",
  " Some of them even called her \u201cMom",
  "\u201d Not only was she my hero, she was theirs too",
  "\u00a0My mom never threw away the clothes that my sister and I would grow out of because she wanted to give them to the kids at school who were struggling financially",
  " She is the most selfless person I know and she inspires me every day",
  " She always thinks of others before herself and makes sure to give back when she can",
  " She is a great example of never forgetting where you come from",
  " Although she may not be the wealthiest, she gives the most she can to try and prevent others from struggling",
  " If she could, she would make sure that nobody lacks anything in their life",
  " The many positive characteristics that my mom possesses inspire me to be a better individual and motivate me when I am going through difficult times",
  " She is the type of mother I hope to be one day",
  "\u00a0My mom has always taught me to be thankful for the things that we do have, and not focus on the things that we don\u2019t",
  " She teaches me to be humble and reminds me that everyone struggles, therefore, no one should be belittled for the problems that they face",
  " She shows me that throughout life, you must encounter every situation with a positive attitude and always remain optimistic",
  "\u00a0Contradictory to the stereotypes made about single-moms being \u201cdesperate for a man\u201d to pay all the bills, heal their broken hearts, and to be a father to their children, my mom never needed a man to get her through life",
  " She raised her twin daughters all on her own",
  " Because of her, my sister and I have recently graduated from 4-year universities with bachelor\u2019s degrees",
  " We are who we are because of our mom",
  " We are strong and independent because of her",
  " We defeated and broke down barriers that were put in front of us because of her",
  " My sister and I are educated, first-generation, Latinas who are the products of a single-mom household",
  " We are living proof that single-moms are strong, hardworking, independent women fully capable of raising children, even twins, to become successful and reach their full potential",
  " These women are just as powerful as two parents together",
  "\u00a0I have never thought of my mom as being anything less than the perfect parent",
  " She does the job of two people and she\u2019s never given less than her very best",
  " In a traditional family, it takes two parents to raise a child; in my family\u2019s case, a single-mother raised twins",
  " She says parenting is her number one job, and our success is her paycheck",
  " Quite frankly, I have never felt like I\u2019ve been missing anything in life",
  " Having an absent father has never phased me and I think the biggest reason for that is because of how successfully my mom has carried her role as a parent",
  " I am proud to say that I come from a single-mother household because it proves women are powerful beings with the ability to fully fulfill a father\u2019s parenting role while simultaneously fulfilling her own role as a mother",

  " I sat back and I watched her wonderful spark fade",
  " I sat there and I watched as her eyes dulled, her tears evaporated, and her smile stiffened",
  "I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t do anything, I didn\u2019t say stop, I didn\u2019t even show her any understanding",
  " I just let the hurt wrap around her, like a shameful blanket suffocating and smothering her efforts to speak out",
  "I let her down, I let her lose hope",
  " I allowed her to lose her sanity and I watched her continue to mask her despair and apparent loneliness",
  " I began to question myself, there had to be a reason why I was so unwilling to help her",
  "She must deserve it, right",
  " These things do not happen to the innocent",
  " Girls who live a good life are treated well",
  " She really must be a complete bitch, just like he says she is",
  " I\u2019m not 100% convinced yet though, she has always been kind to me in the past, but I suppose you never really know someone\u2019s true colours",
  "I saw her again today and I watched her with him",
  " It can\u2019t be as bad as she makes it out to be",
  " She clearly eats",
  " He doesn\u2019t let her starve, that\u2019s for sure",
  " If anything, she perhaps could do with eating a bit less, he has warned her, that she is getting tubby",
  " Maybe she should feel ashamed of the way she looks, after all, he is so handsome and charming",
  " He is looking out for her when he tells her to watch what she is eating",
  " It\u2019s a kindness",
  "Wow, she really must be crazy",
  " He told me today that she is nuts and she makes up situations in her won head and tries to blame him",
  " Maybe he is the real victim here",
  " He seems a lot more convincing than she does",
  " He is so articulate and able to express himself clearly, while she is just a blubbering mess most of the time, she does not make any sense",
  " I want to laugh at her sometimes, with him, she is bonkers",
  "Ok, I\u2019m starting to feel sorry for him now",
  " He really does put up with so much of her shit",
  " She is so controlling, she asks him so many questions",
  " He is so patient when he answers her and then she has the nerve to say he told her something different earlier",
  " Why is she asking him the same question again then",
  " She is mental",
  " She ahs even started refusing to leave the flat, he says she will not go anywhere unless he goes with her",
  " Like she\u2019s scared of him cheating, so he told me",
  " Although, by the sound of it, this all stems from her guilty conscience",
  " Last week, on her way back from lecture, he saw her flirting with another guy",
  " She of course denied it all, he had to tell her several time, that he saw her with his own eyes",
  " She eventually apologised and said it would never happen again",
  "She really is a nightmare",
  " He\u2019s had to start monitoring the way she dresses",
  " She is such a tart",
  " She wanted to go out with a face full of make up and a short skirt the other night",
  " He told her straight, you look like a cheap tart",
  " He said that nobody would want to see her make a fool of herself",
  " She eventually got changed into something more respectable and toned down the make-up",
  " She probably wanted other men to look at her, she seems to like the attention",
  " She\u2019s lucky to have him, most men would have run a mile by now",
  "I don\u2019t know how she dares",
  " She tried to tell me a pack of nasty lies today",
  " She showed me some bruises on her thighs and some red marks too",
  " She had clearly done them to herself for attention",
  " He had already warned me that she was crazy enough to make stuff up",
  " I was a bit scared that she was going to freak out on me",
  " He told me in confidence, that he once had to physically restrain her for her own safety, that\u2019s why she had read marks on her wrists once",
  "  She is properly deluded",
  "He is a total saint",
  " I\u2019ve completely stopped listening to her now",

  " There has been a significant improvement in her behaviour",
  " She seems much less mental now",
  " She has stopped making things up, she\u2019s dressing in clothes that cover up her flaws and she is so much quieter now",
  " She never causes a stir, she just needed to stop attention seeking",
  " He said, as soon as people stop giving her attention, she will calm down and realise that she doesn\u2019t need attention from others, she has everything she needs from him",
  "So, she kept her mouth shut, she dressed how he liked her to dress",
  " She got fatter, she stopped wearing make-up",
  " She stopped going out with her inappropriate friends, they found her boring now she was in a relationship now anyway",
  " She closed herself off from the world, she stopped going back home to visit her family, she accepted it was not cost effective",

  "Dedication: Every single girl and woman who doesn't know how infinitely powerful she is",
  "I am going to tell you my full story",
  " There&#8217;s several people who know different chapters of this, but not a single soul that&#8217;s ever known the whole thing",
  " Why am I doing this",
  " Well, I am hoping to inspire and help",
  " I am 29 years old and the past 8 years of my life have been dedicated to healing myself from within",
  " If you are easily triggered by mentions of (child) sexual abuse, self harm, depression and other mental health problems, please consider whether you want to read on, although I am going to end this on a positive note, which maybe you can just skip to",
  "My childhood has been very traumatic",
  " It all started at the age of 2 1/2 when my parents split up",
  " My mother and I moved in with my grandparents and although I don&#8217;t remember much from this time (2 1/2 to about 6 years), I know from stories that my grandfather was an alcoholic at the time and my mother&#8217;s new boyfriend was addicted to heroin",
  " Shortly after she got pregnant with my younger half brother, something happened that made her break up with him and ban him from ever coming near our house ever again",
  " According to what I&#8217;ve been told, it was the result of a fight they&#8217;ve had over his drug addiction",
  " He never got to see his son and committed suicide a few years later",
  " I will get to why this is important at a later point",
  "So I was 5 years old, my mother was a stressed out single parent who was carrying her own burden of PTSD, and our relationship deteriorated",
  " I experienced her as cold, unloving, physically violent at times, verbally abusive, untrustworthy and unreliable",
  " She would threaten to abandon me in the woods or at the orphanage and actually drive me there in order to scare me and make me obedient",
  " This deteriorating continued throughout her new marriage, which took place when I was 10 years old and worsened from this point on",
  " My step father, an ex veteran and also heavily traumatised, tried to discipline us by putting us down, because he believed this was the only way to motivate us to prove him wrong",
  " Mental health issues were a big taboo, because for him they were equal to weakness, so under his influence my mother never thought about taking me to see a therapist or getting me the help that I needed",
  " I remember passing a lot of my pain and anger on to my younger brother by hurting and teasing him wherever I could, which is something I feel deeply sorry for nowadays, whilst at the same time now I have profound compassion for the hurt child that I was",
  " My second and youngest half brother was born and I felt like such an outsider to &#8216;their&#8217; family",
  " Throughout all these years my father was my only point of refuge, however due to his own struggles with mental health and panic attacks, he was unable to look after me full time",
  " I first started suffering from depression at the age of 13",
  " Shortly after I was having suicidal thoughts and began to self harm",
  " I remember keeping a little glass bottle under my pillow that I would collect my tears in",
  " My feelings of being unloved, unworthy, lonely and fundamentally flawed seemed to be eating me up alive, this is the only way I can describe the amount of emotional pain I was in",
  " I went to a very prestigious school, technically, although I used to skip lessons all the time, until I quit in year 10 (= age 17 in my home country)",
  " I just couldn&#8217;t take it anymore",
  " I didn&#8217;t care about my future, because I had been taught not to care about myself",
  " After all, no one else seemed to care about me either",
  " I had made my fair share of experiences with bullying, but nothing compared to the bullying at home and the frequent, humiliating physical fights I would have with my mother",
  " Being dragged around by my hair or with her hand like a vice on the back of my neck and pushed down the stairs to my room",
  " When I was 18, I decided to move as far away from home as I possibly could and got my own apartment in a city halfway across the country",
  " My plan was to get my high school degree and turn my life around, instead the unresolved trauma issues caused the following (almost) 3 years to be a blur of drugs, alcohol, physical self harm, attracting the wrong kind of boys and letting them use me as some sort of sexual doormat",
  " Some of these encounters were technically rape, but at that point in time, I didn&#8217;t care",
  " I was desperate for love and was willing to do whatever it took to get some attention",
  " I had suicidal thoughts all the time and endangered my life willingly on more than one occasion",
  " Things seemed to go uphill when I met my first real boyfriend, by real I mean, the first kind of relationship that was built on mutual feelings and respect for each other",
  " It was an on / off thing and when he finally broke up with me, I was so heartbroken I felt like I was actually dying",
  "Back to my mother&#8217;s junkie boyfriend and me as a 5 year old&#8230; for so long I have struggled to understand why exactly I had been suffering with all these mental health problems until a few years back when I was starting to have a strange suspicion that some form of sexual abuse took place during that time which I don&#8217;t seem to be able to remember",
  " Adding up all the little clues from my adult perspective, my alarm bells went off immediately",
  " Suddenly everything seemed to make sense",
  " I am not just talking about everything I mentioned above, I am talking about unusual sexualised behaviour that is not normal for a child of the age that I was then, so maybe 5 to 10 years old",
  " It seems obvious that I was trying to tell people what had happened but couldn&#8217;t put it in words back then",
  " I don&#8217;t really want to go into too much detail here, but if you took every list of tell tale signs for childhood sexual abuse any psychologist has ever made, I would have ticked most of the boxes",
  " So a new problem arose for me, especially after the big debate of false abuse memories and whether it&#8217;s possible to completely block out something like this",
  " Could it be possible",
  " After years of inner work, self reflection and research I can say, yes it is 100% possible, it isn&#8217;t even uncommon",
  " Our brains have their own inbuilt self protection mechanism",
  " I was faced with the question of how to deal with something I had zero credentials for, something that if I told anyone, they wouldn&#8217;t take me seriously for, because after all, how can I claim something I cannot remember",
  " The only solution I could find for myself was the one to take myself very seriously, yet not without questioning my own factsheet",
  " I have spent years wondering, then pushing it away again, calling myself crazy",
  " All I can say about this sort of dilemma is: Check the facts, listen to your intuition, don&#8217;t jump to conclusions too quickly, listen to how certain things make you feel",
  " I read somewhere once that if you suspect forgotten abuse, it most likely happened",
  " So, I am going to say it: I have been abused as a child and I don&#8217;t remember any of it",
  " I am not alone in this",
  " It is a real thing",
  "On my way to a balanced, happy life, the first time something in my head clicked, was a few months short of my 21st birthday, when I was randomly in the shower and a sentence from a TV series popped into my head, &#8216;Whenever I feel sad, I just stop being sad and be awesome instead",
  "&#8217; I was so sick and tired of feeling depressed all the time that I thought, wait, what if I have the power to change this",
  " And this was the first moment, the first little step towards realising that I alone have the power, that I am in control of my own life",
  " Fast forward 8 years, I have attained quite a bit of knowledge about psychology and developed a much bigger understanding for why I acted the way I did",
  " I think this was a profound trigger on the way to healing myself",
  " All that you need to do so is already within you",
  " I stopped looking for help outside of myself, stopped feeling like a victim, practised self care and compassion, read hundreds of books on spirituality and dug through all the layers of my mind and soul to unearth the roots of my trauma in order to eliminate its effects",
  " I still am, every day, it&#8217;s an ongoing, very slow process, but I have already come so far, I never would have thought this was possible even for a second",
  " That I could feel at peace and in love with myself and the world around me",
  "I have never had therapy, which is not something I am promoting in any way, I would always recommend seeking help if and when you need it",
  " It&#8217;s just that the protective walls I had built around myself were so massive I was unable to let anyone through to me or ask for help, which is actually something I still struggle with a little bit these days, but I&#8217;m working on it",
  " My biggest goal is to cultivate all the good things I was lacking before within myself and to one day, once the wound isn&#8217;t so fresh anymore, make it my mission to support others who need the help and input I so desperately needed",
  "I guess, what I want to say is, if you are going through or went through anything similar, just know that you are worthy in your very essence as a human being, you are energy in a body, how amazing is that, you are so worthy of all the love in this universe, look after your inner child and BE the very person you need the most",
  " I love you",
  " I really do",
  "",
  "Dedication: I dedicate this story to anyone who is struggling with loving and having confidence in themselves",
  "I was born with a craniofacial disease called Stickler Syndrome, which I inherited from my mother ",
  " Oddly, my mother does not know where she got our commonly shared disease from",
  " This disease has caused me to be severely nearsighted, have bad hearing, a short nose, a slightly flat face, and  has caused me to experience some slight symptoms of scoliosis at a young age ",
  " As a kid, I\u2019ve had several consultations about having reconstructive surgery on my nose, I have had hearing aids, and I have incredibly thick glasses ",
  " This disease has also taken a huge toll on my self esteem, as I\u2019ve been bullied, not only by kids, but by adults as well",
  " I remember one time being at a family friends house and hearing a guest say \u201cThat\u2019s one ugly child",
  "\u201d Kids also would refer to me as \u201cfour eyes\u201d and \u201cugly\u201d",
  " In elementary school, I got a vision teacher who I\u2019d meet with and I\u2019d receive tools like a Portable CCTV, iPad ,and magnifying glasses to better the way I see in school",
  " The vision teacher stayed with me until 8th grade because I felt like I no longer needed them anymore and they were extremely distracting because they\u2019d constantly pull me out of class",
  " I started to feel so bad about my appearance and the fact that I needed a \u201cvision teacher\u201d, I stopped caring about how I looked ",
  " I\u2019d go to school carelessly",
  " My hair would be messy, my lips were chapped, my breath was smelly, and My skin would be hard and ashy because I didn\u2019t take care of myself",
  " The only thing that looked decent were my clothes because my mom ironed them until I got a certain age and was forced to do it myself",
  " I also stopped using my CCTV, iPad, and magnifying glasses to avoid being seen",
  " On top of that, I became very hostile towards my classmates and teachers, and would get in trouble frequently for my attitude",
  " I became very tomboyish because I felt like I wasn\u2019t pretty enough to do anything girly, like paint my nails and put on dresses ",
  "  At the age of 10, I endured my first surgery to fix the bridge of my nose so that my glasses would stop sliding off my face ",
  " As I quickly recovered, I noticed that I was having frequent, daily nose bleeds",
  " The surgeon who operated on me said it was drainage, but little did I know, my surgery had been botched ",
  " They used a donor bone to reconstruct my nose, but there was a problem",
  " There was no blood going through my nose to support that bone so it died ",
  " I spent almost three whole years with these everyday nose bleeds and my confidence continued to plummet",
  " Adding to that, there was a disgusting odor coming out of my nose ",
  " I suddenly became very socially awkward because who wants to be friends with the girl with thick glasses and a bloody nose ",
  " At the age of 13, I underwent my second surgery to remove the bone in my nose ",

  "Chapter 2As I said, I was born almost three months earlier than I should have been",
  " I spent weeks in the ICU with breathing problems",
  " None of my body was fully developed; you could see through my skin (my bones, eyes, veins), and I fit in the palm of my Dad&#8217;s hand",
  " When my parents finally got to take me home for the first time, I believe it was around Thanksgiving",
  " I was on a heart monitor with wires everywhere",
  " Everyone was so scared to hold me because they thought I might break",
  "After Thanksgiving, I had to go back to the hospital until Christmas, where I was finally able to go home again",
  " Everyone including my doctor was worried that I wouldn&#8217;t live long",
  " When I was in the hospital my heart stopped a few times",
  "Chapter 3When I was four or five, I had to have my first surgery",
  " I had dislocated both of my hips; they had popped out of their sockets because of the way I would always sit and the way I crawled (at this point in time I still could not walk)",
  " They call it &#8220;W sitting&#8221;",
  " It&#8217;s where both legs are on either side of your body and if you sit in the middle, your lower body will look like it&#8217;s making a W",
  " When I had the surgery, the doctors put my hips back in their sockets by putting pins and screws in to keep them in place",
  "Recovering from this surgery was hard on my family and I",
  " With the cast I had on, I could not move my legs at all and there was a bar in the middle to keep them apart",
  "The second surgery I had was just to remove all the pins and screws they had put in with the first",
  " Again, I had a cast",
  "After the second surgery, I had months of physical therapy (PT) to get my muscles working so I could start walking",
  " It took a lot of time and hard work",
  "Chapter 4I was born with cerebral palsy",
  "Cerebral- Latin cerebrum, meaning affects part of the brain",
  " Palsy, meaning lack of muscle control",
  " Cerebral palsy is caused by abnormal development of the brain that affects a person&#8217;s ability to control muscles",
  " According to History on CP on the American CP Foundation website, studies of this condition began in the 19th century by William John Little, after spastic diplegia was called &#8220;Little&#8217;s disease&#8221;",
  " Canadian physician, William Osler, first named it &#8220;cerebral palsy&#8221; from the German zerebrale Kinderl\u00e4hmung, meaning cerebral child-paralysis",
  " Although cerebral palsy is not a hereditary condition, genetic influences can cause small effects on many genes",
  " Doctors are still unsure what causes the brain to develop this way, but there are many theories",
  " Cerebral palsy is not preventable, but maybe one day with gene therapy it could be managed better",
  " It is a neurological disorder caused by a non-progressive brain injury that can happen when a child&#8217;s brain is still developing",
  " The condition mostly deals with movement and muscle coordination",
  " This means that anyone born with cerebral palsy will have a loss in motor skills",
  " It can be different for everyone with cerebral palsy, but overall there are four main types",
  " Each of these four types can have a different effect on the brain and body",
  " This page will explore the different types of cerebral palsy, the effects it can have on the brain, the effects it has on the body, different ways to treat cerebral palsy, and how one&#8217;s disability can take a toll on the whole family",
  "When it comes to types of CP, spastic is the most common form",
  " It can cause stiff muscles, which leads to jerky or repeated movements of the arms or legs",
  " Another type of cerebral palsy is dyskinetic",
  " With this, muscle movement is slow and uncontrollable",
  " Along with the legs, arms, hands and feet, muscles in the face can be affected as well",
  " Ataxic",
  " This kind of CP affects balance and depth perception, which can make things like writing and reading hard",
  " The last type of CP is called Mixed, which means that someone could have symptoms of all the other kinds of CP at once",
  " While there is no cure, treatment can help someone with CP have a better quality of life",
  "Damage to the white matter of the brain affects the responsibility for transmitting signals inside the brain and to the rest of the body",
  " White matter is found in the deeper tissues of the brain",
  " It contains nerve fibers, which are extensions of nerve cells",
  " Many of these nerve fibers are surrounded by a type of sheath or covering called myelin",
  " Myelin gives the white matter its color",
  " It&#8217;s a mixture of proteins and phospholipids",
  " Damage from periventricular leukomalacia or PVL looks like tiny holes in the white matter of a brain",
  " These gaps in brain tissue interfere with the normal transmission of signals",
  " Researchers have identified selective weaknesses in the developing brain",
  " If you were to look at the brain scan of someone who has CP, it would show a lot of white in different areas of the brain depending on the type of CP that person has",
  " Someone that doesn&#8217;t have cerebral palsy has little or no white showing up on their scans",
  "  In a brain with no white, things are connected as they should be and all the nerves and muscles work as they should",
  " A brain with cerebral palsy however, has white spaces meaning there&#8217;s nothing there, and connections can&#8217;t be made over that area",
  " Connections have to find another way and because of this, some nerves are more sensitive than others and some muscles don&#8217;t work as well as others",
  " In the end, everything is connected",
  " Depending on the type of CP, messages just take more time to get sent out or reserved",
  " So it can take someone with cerebral palsy longer to understand some things because messages can take longer to get to their destination",
  "Cerebral palsy affects the motor area of the brain&#8217;s outer layer, the cerebral cortex",
  " That has several functions of the body like determining intelligence, determining personality, motor function, planning and organization, touch sensation, processing sensory information, and language processing",
  " Someone with CP can have trouble in these areas depending on how severe the condition is",
  " For example, in one arm the nerves could be so sensitive you could feel everything and in the other you wouldn&#8217;t be able to feel anything",
  "There&#8217;s a lot of treatments and ways to manage this disability",
  " For some, it means getting surgery",
  " People with severe contractures may need surgery on bones or joints to place their arms, hips or legs in their correct positions",
  " Surgical procedures can lengthen muscles and tendons that are too short because of severe contractures",
  " These corrections can lessen pain and improve mobility, and may make it easier to do everyday things",
  " In some severe cases, when other treatments haven&#8217;t helped, surgeons may cut the nerves serving the spastic muscles",
  " This relaxes the muscle and reduces pain, but can also cause numbness",
  "Cerebral palsy is not only a disability that affects the people who have it, but it also affects the people around them in many ways like stress caused by medical bills, insurance, and making your home handicapped accessible",
  " These are just a few examples of how CP is known to be one of the most depressing conditions of families",
  " When it comes to insurance companies, they don&#8217;t always want to pay for things and they may drag things out as long as possible",
  " In order to make your home handicapped accessible, it takes a lot of money",
  " You may have to pay for ramps, handrails, special bathroom things, and many other changes that might have to be done to make the life of someone with CP better",
  " That in itself can be stressful",
  " Parents often worry about how their child is going to handle life by themselves",
  " Questions parents tend to ask are: &#8216;Who&#8217;s going to help them get around",
  "&#8217; or, &#8216;How will they take care of their own family when that time comes",
  "&#8217; Parents shouldn&#8217;t worry about any of these things as much as they think they should, as there are so many programs and places that are made for helping kids/people with CP or any disability once they are on their own",
  "It is hard some days to have to deal with CP but my family and I make it work",
  "Chapter 5Along with all my surgeries and the physical disadvantages I&#8217;ve had to deal with, I&#8217;ve also had a few mental problems",
  " Throughout the years I&#8217;ve had to deal with depression",
  " My depression came from the fact that my parents didn&#8217;t help me as much as you&#8217;d think",
  " Sure they took me to all my appointments and helped me after surgery, but what they never have been able to understand is that a mental state comes with my disability and being a teen too",
  " That&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve always had trouble dealing with; the idea that they don&#8217;t understand me",
  "I&#8217;ve also had to deal with anxiety, with my biological mother",
  " As I was growing up around my mother, I had to deal with her yelling and throwing things all over the house",
  " While she is getting help now and it&#8217;s working, I still have trouble",
  "There are times when my depression, anxiety, or both at the same time are so bad I&#8217;d go days without eating a full meal",
  " I&#8217;d eat just enough to not starve to death and I&#8217;d stop sleeping",
  " All that fun stuff",
  "I guess my depression got worse when my grandparents passed",
  " First it was my biological mother&#8217;s father",
  " I was in the living room with my little sister and my cousin; my grandpa was dying in the kitchen",
  " I watched him go",
  " Then a month or so later, it was my dad&#8217;s father",
  " He had died minutes after we walked out of the hospital",
  " We didn&#8217;t even get to the car before we got the phone call",
  " A few years later, we went to the house to have my dad&#8217;s mom fill out paperwork",
  " We walked into the house to find her on the floor",
  " It took us two hours to get her to come with us to the hospital",
  " When we finally got her to go to the hospital we found out, if I remember right, she had brain bleeding and her liver was failing because of all the wine she drank (my grandma did love her wine)",
  " She was gone about a week later",
  " We had just arrived back from the hospital, and had just got into the house when we got the call",
  "In the months after, we worked on cleaning out their house and cleaning their things",
  " It was very emotional",
  " We soon sold the house and I can&#8217;t help but wonder if in some way my grandparents are still around",
  " What I am getting at is that it&#8217;s okay to not be okay",
  " It&#8217;s okay",
  "Chapter 6Depression to me means feeling out of place in the world, not wanting to do anything",
  " Not enjoying life or activities like you once did",
  "There are more than 3 million U",
  "S cases of depression per year",
  " Possible causes include a combination of biological, psychological, and social sources of distress",
  " Every year, more and more research suggests these factors change brain function",
  "When our parents were growing up, depression wasn&#8217;t a word in their dictionary",
  " So nowadays when kids say they have these mental health experiences, most parents say it&#8217;s all a &#8220;teenage thing&#8221; and that &#8220;you&#8217;ll grow out of it&#8221;",
  " With every medical case though, we find that it&#8217;s not always the case",
  "The World Health Organization (WHO), estimates that each year approximately one million people die from suicide around the world",
  " That&#8217;s 16 people per 100,000, or one death every 40 seconds",
  "Depression is a big part of my life, and it might not be something I can completely get over, but I know now that there is help",
  " Steps I can take to better understand this mental illness",
  " Steps I can take to help handle it better",
  " I would be lying if I said I hadn&#8217;t thought about suicide in the past, but I&#8217;ve gotten help and a few very supportive people in my life and I&#8217;m doing okay",

  " For me, I overthink everything; anxiety doesn&#8217;t help that",
  " It&#8217;s living in a constant state of \u201cOh my god",
  " What now",
  "&#8221;Anxiety can take any confidence you have, make it harder to do well in school, going out with friends, family or maybe a significant other",
  " Someone I know once said, &#8220;I totally get it",
  " Just remember, all it is, it&#8217;s just energy in your body",

  "Chapter 8My life overall has been both real amazing and real hard",
  " New challenges every day, new reasons to be happy every day",
  " Some of my biggest reasons to be happy everyday are my friends, my family (most of them) and my amazing boyfriend",
  " If one of them makes me smile at any point in the day, it changes my whole day",
  "Every day, I wake up at 5:30 in the morning, get ready for school, and I&#8217;m out the door by 7:00-7:15 in the morning",
  " During that time in getting ready my parents help me with everything",
  " Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I can do everything by myself, it just takes me a lot longer so for anything that I need to hurry up for I ask for help",
  " And asking for help is okay, don&#8217;t ever feel like asking for help makes you weak",
  " Asking for help shows people that you want to get better at something so maybe next time you won&#8217;t need help",

  " School ends at 2:40 in the afternoon, so I go to my after school program until around 5:00-5:30 at night until my dad can get done with work",
  "My friends are so great and a big help in my life, at school, and they help me if I need someone to talk to or a shoulder to cry on",
  " They are just that extra bit of support that everyone needs",
  " Although sometimes I feel like I&#8217;m not there enough for them and that I don&#8217;t help them enough",
  " I feel like for them being my friend is really hard",
  " If they wanted to go somewhere with me we&#8217;d have to walk or wait for my Dad to take us whereas with their other friends, if one drives you just hop in the car and drive",
  " I don&#8217;t get to hang out the way I want to with my friends and because of that, I don&#8217;t get to go out much",
  "When I realize that I don&#8217;t get to go out much and it really brings me down, my boyfriend is usually the one who picks me back up; helping me realize that my friends are my friends for a reason, no matter the fact that I can&#8217;t get around easily",
  " Every day I&#8217;ll get at least two or three messages asking me how I&#8217;m doing and if I need to talk",
  " We help each other out, and most nights we end up falling asleep on the phone, which really helps your mind see that someone cares about you when you&#8217;re dealing with depression and anxiety",
  "***When dealing with hard times in life, make sure you build yourself a great support system of people",
  " It can be people you talk to in school or people you&#8217;re friends with that don&#8217;t go to school with you",
  " It can be anyone you trust",
  " It also helps when things are really bad, to watch your favorite movie or movies and get lost in them for a while and when it&#8217;s done you may see that what you were stressed out about before doesn&#8217;t really matter anymore",
  " That&#8217;s what I do",
  " If you&#8217;re not a big movie person, try books",
  " They work just as well",
  " ***Chapter 9When I was younger I didn&#8217;t have a care in the world",
  " Nothing bothered me",
  " I didn&#8217;t think having the challenges I do was that big of a deal but as I got older, it got harder for me to respect myself and my challenges",
  " Everything from school to friends to family to other relationships like with my boyfriend",
  "When you think of abusive relationships you tend to think: boyfriend/girlfriend or husband/wife and physical abuse",
  " You never seem to think of friendships and verbal or mental",
  " I don&#8217;t want to call it abuse and make my amazing friends feel like they&#8217;re doing something wrong because they&#8217;re not",
  " I got rid of all the abusive people in my life",
  "Before I was smart enough to kick all of them out of my life, my boyfriend saved me from one",
  " I was too scared to break the friendship off on my own, my now boyfriend helped me",
  " Every day I thank him",
  " Life may get hard and not be all rainbows and sunshine, but you can get past all the hardships",
  " Don&#8217;t give up, I never have",
  "Chapter 10&#8220;Everyone who reads this book is inspired",
  " Your words heal a part of a broken heart in a way I&#8217;ve never seen before",
  " The strength that lies in your words is unbelievable",
  " You have been through so much and there are no words to describe how much I adore your bravery and strength",
  "&#8221;&#8220;You, Cassidy Jansen, have a gift",
  " Don&#8217;t be afraid to share it with the world",
  " \u2764&#8221;    &#8220;I think you are brave for opening up about your life, not many people have the courage to do that",
  "&#8221;    &#8220;The fact that you expose yourself to the world shows how strong you are",
  "&#8221;    &#8220;Awesome",
  "&#8221;    &#8220;Very Inspirational",
  "&#8221;    &#8220;Cassidy J",
  " If you were to ask me who she is, I&#8217;d tell you this",
  " We have been friends for a long time, about six years",
  " I met Cassidy in summer school, and later on in life we went to school together, and will most likely graduate high school together",
  " But when I first met her, I knew something in the way we connected that I&#8217;d have a lifelong friend",
  " We have been through our up and downs in our friendship, any relationship does, quote on quote &#8220;break ups&#8221;, drama and fights, but I couldn&#8217;t ask for a better friend",
  " Call it a kindred spirit or whatever but she is like a sister to me",
  " She makes me laugh, and smile, and roll my eyes at times, but doesn&#8217;t family sometimes make you frustrated",
  " But you can always make up and forgive, no matter how long it takes",
  " Family isn&#8217;t always just blood",
  " She is my sister as I see it",
  " Loving, kind, caring and has the strength I only wish I had",
  " She&#8217;s the annoying sister, the caring sister and someone I know I can always trust when I can&#8217;t trust others",
  " Sometimes I feel like I listen to her more than she listens to me, but she has been there for me when I need it most and that means more to me than having her listen to me grip and complain",
  " I don&#8217;t want to worry her with more than I need to",
  "  The fact that I know she&#8217;ll always be there for me, and me for her is something I count and hold high",
  " My trust in her runs deep",
  " And if you say she&#8217;s just someone with a disability and she in a wheelchair, no she is not",
  " I don&#8217;t see the wheelchair, it doesn&#8217;t make her who she is",
  " She doesn&#8217;t let it define who she is",
  " She is smart, and witty, and kind",
  " She is just like me and you and she can do anything she puts her mind to, I&#8217;ve seen her do it",
  " There was a time I didn&#8217;t talk to her at all and was mad",
  " I held a grudge for a long time",
  " I soon realized that yeah, I could be mad, and could never talk to her again, but I wanted my best friend, and my sister",
  " We cleared the air, and yeah, things changed, a lot, but I believe in the end we both came out stronger for it",
  " And in a way, I felt like something inside me was telling me that she wasn&#8217;t a friend to let go and fade away like others in the past I had",
  " That she was here to stay and have my back and I was to have hers",
  " So through all the hardships we&#8217;ve had, we have had more moments of happiness and I couldn&#8217;t ask for anything more",
  " So that&#8217;s who Cassidy is, and more than I can write or say",
  " All I know is this, I wouldn&#8217;t trade my sister for anything",
  "&#8221;    &#8220;I read this every day",
  " I wait every day for an update",
  " I really like it",
  " It&#8217;s really good",
  "&#8221;&#8220;I learnt more from your story then I do in a week of school and I feel I&#8217;ve known you for ages even though we&#8217;ve never met",
  " Your story is really inspirational and your hardships have been challenging but you prove that anyone can keep going",
  " I feel bad for every time I&#8217;ve ever thought my life was hard or complained to my parents because your story opened me up to real challenge and I never actually realized what some people go through",
  " You&#8217;re really inspirational and it must have been tough writing about all this but I&#8217;m glad you did and I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll give insight to many others",
  "Growing up as the happy little girl that I was, at 4 years old you could ask me what I wanted to be when I grew up and I would answer that I wanted to be singer/songwriter",
  " As I got older I still held onto that dream because of my grandparents",
  " They kept me going",
  " I still write and sing today, but I&#8217;ve focused on other things",
  "    After a few years, I began to see that things weren&#8217;t right with the world",
  " People needed help everywhere",
  " People were dying, take 9/11/2001 for example",
  " According to CNN NEWS, &#8220;At the World Trade Center (WTC) site in Lower Manhattan, 2,753 people were killed when hijacked American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 were intentionally crashed into the north and south towers, or as a result of the crashes",
  "&#8221;Seeing things like that, while I was not yet born to see such horrific a day, I learned about it in school, I wanted to help people",
  " I wanted to join the military, have my boots on the ground just like every other great man and woman out there",
  " Fighting for our freedom every day, having to leave their families for months at a time to protect the freedom Americans take for granted",
  "I wanted my boots on the ground, I wanted to take the fight to them and show people that the United States doesn&#8217;t give up without a fight, but sadly, one day I looked in the mirror",
  " Wheelchair and all, I began to see what people talked about every time I said that I wanted to serve my country",
  " I remember clear as day, like it was yesterday, being in one of my classes and someone from the military comes in to talk about career opportunities and such",
  " At the end of that hour I went up to him, told him what I wanted to do",
  " He asked me a few questions about my disability which I happily answered correctly then he says, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry but with dealing with that you wouldn&#8217;t be able to join in the way you&#8217;re looking to",
  "&#8221;I completely understood but I was still heartbroken",
  " I had two things going on in my head that day",
  " The &#8220;I&#8217;ll prove you wrong&#8221; attitude and the &#8220;yeah okay sure&#8221; attitude",
  " I went with the &#8220;Yeah okay sure&#8221; attitude",
  " While I still haven&#8217;t given up completely on that dream I have gone for things within my reach for now",
  "I&#8217;ve done so many amazing things in my life but every day I wake up and feel like I could be doing more for the people I love",
  " It is good to stay within your comfort zone but if you want to join the Navy SEALS and help the world one day, don&#8217;t let anyone stop you from trying to do so",
  " Fight for what you believe in and what you want out of life, don&#8217;t give up",
  "Dear Grandma,Since the day we stopped talking, after Grandpa passed away, I&#8217;ve missed you",
  " After we lost him I had a hard time talking to you because I no longer saw the spark in your eyes, I no longer saw that happiness; I suppose that happiness left when Grandpa did",
  " Nonetheless I couldn&#8217;t handle seeing you so heartbroken&#8230; it broke me",
  " And because of that I had to stay away from the house, but then I lost you; it was really hard to say goodbye",
  " I really didn&#8217;t get a chance to",
  " Today, I carry regret for not being there like I should have been",
  " You were my rock, I should have been yours and I wasn&#8217;t",
  " I carry more regret at the fact I had so much to say and didn&#8217;t, now I&#8217;ll never have that chance",
  " It&#8217;s been about three years since I lost you and that regret gets heavier and heavier every day",
  " I&#8217;m carrying the regret because it&#8217;s all I have left of you and Grandpa, the memories are fading away and I can&#8217;t stop them, it&#8217;s like I&#8217;m losing you all over again",
  " I can&#8217;t handle that",
  " I think what bothers me the most, other than the regret itself is that I put it on myself, I didn&#8217;t really choose for it to happen",
  " I wish I could in a way put it down and walk away but what if I do and forget you and Grandpa",
  " I know it can&#8217;t happen but the fear is still there; carrying this regret and fear is really hard on me",
  " It&#8217;s really hard in my day to day life",
  " It mentally drains me of almost everything, without it though I&#8217;d feel lost, it&#8217;s all I have left of the both of you",
  " Say &#8220;Hi&#8221; to Grandpa for me",
  "Love,Your &#8220;Angel&#8221;, Cassidy Dear Grandpa,I already wrote a letter to Grandma, but I thought I&#8217;d write one to you even though I don&#8217;t know what to say, or I have so much to say I have no idea how to do it",
  " I guess, this is more for me then you, because like I told Grandma I haven&#8217;t really gotten past the fact that you&#8217;re gone",
  " I miss you",
  " I&#8217;m lost in my own head, I don&#8217;t know what I should say here, and dealing with your death was really hard because just a few months before we lost you, we lost my Mom&#8217;s Dad",
  " In a way I feel like I&#8217;m not over your death because of the way I left Grandma alone after",
  "I grew up thinking nothing could kill you, I grew up calling you Superman",
  " The whole family thought of you as Superman",
  " Once we got to the house I tried to lighten the mood and said, &#8220;I guess Grandpa found his Kryptonite",
  "&#8221; I got a few smiles out of it",
  " I know this isn&#8217;t as long as the letter I wrote to Grandma but it&#8217;s always been hard talking to you",
  " I never knew what to say, but that doesn&#8217;t change the fact that I miss you and I love you",
  "I remember sleeping over and the house every once in a while, it seemed every time I did I had a spelling test and you would quiz on the drive to school and you kept going until I got most or all of them right",
  " It&#8217;s because of that I&#8217;m really good at spelling and doing really well in my book",
  "Anyway, I love you",
  " I miss you",
  "Love, Cassidy",
  "Okay, it all started with the battery not doing so well",
  " Draining faster than it should, having to be charged more often",
  " Things that happen when it&#8217;s cold or if a battery is getting old",
  " I could live with that, seeing I only use the thing at school I didn&#8217;t see much of a problem",
  " But as we all know things tend to happen in threes",
  "Once the battery started acting normal again another part of my chair started acting up, one of the things my chair can do is lean back like a recliner; only without having your legs out in front of you",
  " For safety, the chair as to be at the right angle to drive or you could possibly tip it over, so here&#8217;s how that day went:I go to school with my chair like every other day, go to class to take my ACT&#8217;s, lean my chair back enough so I&#8217;m comfortable for however long it was going to take",
  " Few hours later- after my testing, I go to put my chair down to the safety angle to drive and no matter how I put it, the chair still thought it was tilted and wouldn&#8217;t allow me to drive",
  " So I had to get my teachers to push me around in it until the Wheelchair repair guy came (which took all day) and if I said having my teachers push me around in my 365lbs chair wasn&#8217;t embarrassing I&#8217;d be lying to you",
  "Anyway, so the guys comes, does a few tests then does a work around so I can drive but no longer tilt",
  " Okay fine by me I just want to go home",
  " The next day they came and put in a new part so all that was fixed",
  "Now I&#8217;m not sure where in the line of problems this happened but, the lift on my Dad&#8217;s car, the one I use to take my chair to and from school broke",
  " So now my chair is sitting at school 24/7 until it&#8217;s fixed",
  " I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s really a problem because before I got the lift, my chair would stay at school anyway, but I can tell that the people involved in this problem seem to be a little stressed and I can&#8217;t blame them, having that lift for me got me a little bit more independent",
  " I could actually go out with friends and not have to worry about being back at school before the classroom door was locked",
  " Even though I face all these problems, I still manage to keep my head up",
  " Even on bad days, I really hope my story can help you of those around you",
  " Life can be hard for everyone but for those with disabilities it can be just that much harder",
  " I really enjoyed writing my story, and even though I&#8217;m ending it for now doesn&#8217;t mean the story has to be over",
  "Life keeps going and it can be hard to keep up, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m here to help if you need",
  " I&#8217;m no therapist but I do know how hard it can be even with a supportive family and a great group of friends",
  " I&#8217;m looking to help those who don&#8217;t have that or maybe they do and they just need someone who understands better",

  "When I was a little kid, my mom would always tell me that I had the most amazing attitude that could cheer anyone up",
  " I was always smiling and making jokes to keep my classmates laughing",
  " That all changed when my mom told me that we had to move to another country for my father&#8217;s job",
  " We moved to China where my father&#8217;s work is located and they enrolled me into an international private school where most the rich or middle class foreigners go to school",
  " I am fully Chinese, but my family decided not to sent me to public school because a private one could get be a better education and because I spend most of my life in America, my Chinese was not that good",
  " The first couple of years was okay, but things started to get worse when I was entering middle school",
  " My mom got sick",
  " We had no idea what illness she had until a few years ago, but her illness was getting worse and worse by the day",
  " She would have seizures or wake up screaming in the middle of the night",
  " My dad would skip work in order to take care of her or I would sometimes have to skip school to do it",
  " Before all this happened, I had made a new group of friends with people who were 3-5 years older than me",
  " We would do stuff that was dangerous and partying and I would sometimes come home at 2AM",
  " Once they even got me drunk without my consent",
  " After I had the responsibility to take care my mom, I decided to leave the friend group which was a terrible decision",
  " My old friends started to bully me",
  " They would secretly take photos of me and take about how disgusting I look",

  " I confronted them one day in the bathroom and they got violent",
  " I started to fight back, but three people pinned me down and one of them started punching my stomach",
  " I was left there crying, I was 11",
  " After this, I told my parents that I needed to switch schools; they didn&#8217;t really understand why, but they agreed",
  " I transferred to another private school and was getting a fresh start, or so I thought",
  " I was heavily influenced by what happened to me and it led me to have social anxiety and depression",

  " Until I met this guy who was a few years older than me",
  " He and I quickly became friends and he was always so nice and positive towards everyone",
  " I started to fall for him and we began to date",
  " However, I didn&#8217;t realize how toxic our relationship was until a few years later",
  " He and I were on and off for 3 years, and during that time he would always complain about the way I looked and my behavior",
  " He would constantly insult me, cheated on me multiple times, and try to touch me when we were alone",
  " One day we were alone at his house in which he was trying to touch me again, I said I wasn&#8217;t ready and that I felt uncomfortable",
  " He kept insisting and I kept denying",
  " He got so mad at me, then he dumped me",
  " A girl in my class called me on the phone and asked if I was okay, and I told her everything",
  " I wish I didn&#8217;t because she was secretly recording me with another device and sent it to a private group chat with all my classmates",

  " Knowing what was coming if he found me",
  " On his suicidal days ( which was at least once or twice every clp weeks) he&#8217;d put me in the backseat most of the time by myself because my siblings where much better at hiding than I was",
  " Than he&#8217;d drive to a creek a few miles past our house with a 12 ft drop off into a creek",
  " He&#8217;d go as fast as he&#8217;d could and then slam on the breaks right before the drop coming inches from the edge, hoping that if he does it enough one of the times he&#8217;ll slide off and kill us both",
  " He would talk about wanting to die and how I shouldn&#8217;t be afraid of dying because it&#8217;ll be easier if I wasn&#8217;t around",

  " She dreaded every second of it and would spend the time cracked out with some random guy from the bar",
  " I didn&#8217;t have a room or a bed so when my mom disappeared for 2 days I thought it&#8217;d be safe to sleep in her bed",

  " After he left I gathered all of my courage and told my mom what happened expecting to feel better and ensured that everything would be okay but instead she told me &#8220;he was falling off the bed and needed something to hold on to&#8221; and pushed me aside and continued what she was doing",
  " I know that day I lost a very important part of myself a part of me I never even had a chance to experience",
  " Self respect I felt like I was just a whore put on this Earth for the only purpose to be used and thrown away",
  " The next time my dad went away we where sent into a distant relatives home",
  " She had two boys which are just as messed up as we were if we didn&#8217;t hold her spoon exactly right they would grab us by the arm spinners front of the circle and beat us with a belt the entire experience there was very unpleasant like most my childhood",
  " Every time after that it was a foster home they would split us all up in a different foster homes none of the foster parents that I encountered for nice they wanted us for the paycheck only and Free labor but it was better than being at home",
  " I have been through so much and it has messed me up so much the only thing that keeps me going is my kids making sure that they at the life I wanted growing up they never have to experience any of the horrors I did",
  " From waking up to my dad dragging me down the stairs by my hair to a tub full of water trying to drown me my sister having to pull him off and US hiding outside in the woods to my father trying to rape me used to hold me down and tell me how my hair used to turn him on robe up against me",
  " I was in 4th grade the first time I tried to seriously kill myself by cutting my wrist",
  " I took a fingernail clippers and tried to cut as deep as I could and clipped my vein wanting nothing but to not exist being told my whole life that me being dead would be better for everyone",
  " That is just the very beginning of my story and just a glimpse of my life growing up",
  " We wouldn&#8217;t celebrate holidays except on Christmas the church donated so many presents and we had the joy of opening them all picking one to keep and my father sold and traded the rest for booze",
  " That is one of my happiest memories as a kid, seeing a present with my name on it",
  " Knowing that someone out there cared even if they never met me and all I was to them was a name, I felt great knowing that they even took the time to write my name on that piece of paper",
  " I&#8217;m not going to go through every terrible experience, just the ones that impacted my life and destroyed a part of me inside",

  " I remember when I was screaming she turned her head away as if I was nothing but a little creek in the floor deserving of what was happening to me",
  " Locked in a room for 2 days before they decided they where done with me",
  " I still kept a relationship with joy after that, feeling like I was of worth to her in any way to anyone made me feel like I had a purpose in life",

  " That wasn&#8217;t my first time being raped",
  " My 1st was my sister D husband, snuck into my room and took the only part of me that meant anything away",
  " When I tried to tell and I reported it to the police my sister attacked me everyday calling me a liar and I should die",
  " Finally a couple days before court I was left with a choice to never see my nieces again and her promise to make every second of my life harder than it already was or don&#8217;t show up to court and she would allow me to still be a part of the family",
  " I chose family",
  " When I was about 7 years old not long after my mom&#8217;s bf did what he did my brothers decided to teach me a game called doctor",
  " I&#8217;d have to get naked and lay still and let whatever happen or they would tell Dad that I did or said something so I&#8217;d get the belt",
  " That is something I have never spoken or written",
  " I feel disgusting and scared that if people know or my husband where to know that I would no longer be worthy of love",
  " I am terrified that Everytime anyone looks at me it will only be in disgust",
  " But I am okay with that because I know that no matter what my story is my kids will love me, the one thing I&#8217;m good at in life is being a mom&#8230; Who would of guessed that with everything I&#8217;ve been through and everything that&#8217;s wrong with me the one thing I know for sure is I&#8217;m a good mom",

  " I\u2019m Coach Rebecca",
  " I\u2019ve been involved with Girls on the Run Atlanta since 2016 and have coached three fun and crazy seasons with Paideia and The Atlanta International School",
  " When I\u2019m not working as an event planner or coaching Girls on the Run, you can find me walking, running or biking around Piedmont Park, traveling and working on my sommelier certification",
  " I was born and raised in Atlanta and graduated from the University of Georgia \u2013 Go Dawgs",
  " In addition to coaching, you can find me serving as Co-Chair of the GOTR Young Professionals Board, fundraising as a Sole Mate and/or volunteering in the GOTR office",
  " Needless to say, I\u2019m a bit of a Girls on the Run junkie",
  " I\u2019m constantly in awe of this program and how it enriches the lives of the girls involved as well as the coaches, volunteers, parents and guardians",
  " One of my favorite things about coaching is that no matter what work or life stresses you may bring to practice on any given day and no matter what silly antics the girls may get into, you always leave lighter and filled with so much joy",
  " At its core, Girls on the Run is so much more than a fitness program",
  " It teaches girls how to navigate the world around them with strength and confidence",
  " Growing up, girls are faced with so many challenges and this program approaches these challenges head on, giving girls the tools and confidence they need to overcome any obstacle",
  " I have such a heart for building strong girls and strong women and that\u2019s exactly what Girls on the Run is all about",
  " When the Young Professionals Board was launched last summer, I knew it was something I needed to be involved in so that I could experience Girls on the Run in a new capacity and it has been such an incredible experience",
  " During its inaugural year, we accomplished so many amazing things and I can\u2019t wait to see what next year has in store for this group of talented young professionals who have big hearts for this program",
  " Without question, some of the most rewarding moments of being a coach are watching the girls grow throughout the season, watching them process their emotions and listening to their vulnerabilities",
  " I absolutely love 5k day every fall and spring",
  " It\u2019s so much fun to watch these girls achieve their goals",
  " I have seen girls who were quiet and shy at the beginning of the season find their voices",
  " I\u2019ve watched girls who didn\u2019t think they could run very well crush their goals",
  " I\u2019ve watched their minds process their lessons in ways I wouldn\u2019t have thought possible for 3rd \u2013 5th graders",

  " I\u2019ve learned how GOTR works to meet the needs of all girls and has recently begun giving out small grants to teams in need of things like running hijabs so that every girl is comfortable and has the confidence to excel in this program",
  " I\u2019ve heard about a young girl, who after participating in the Heart and Sole program in middle school, went on to high school and beat several of their long-standing track and field records",
  " And I\u2019ve personally witnessed so many amazing moments as a coach",
  " It has been so fun spending time around all of the strong, smart and talented staff, volunteers and coaches who make Girls on the Run Atlanta possible",
  " Talk about some amazing energy and girl power",
  " It\u2019s contagious",
  " If someone asked me who my biggest inspiration in life was, I\u2019d say I have quite a few",
  " They\u2019re the single moms, working moms, stay at home moms, women who choose not to be moms or who don\u2019t even have the choice to be moms",
  " The girls I coach and the women I coach with",
  " The women with strong, fierce voices and the women with quiet, unwavering determination",
  " The women who lift each other up",
  " The women who advocate for us, breaking barriers and glass ceilings to pave the way for future generations to have it just a little bit easier than they did",
  " The women who are juggling too much because life is messy and complicated but somehow always make it work",

  " Will there be any money left to still pay me",
  "  I guess you could say, I thought about a lot",
  " Then, two and a half weeks in, the Doctor decided she was going to \u201ctry something",
  "\u201d  She was going to put a suture around the artery that was pumping the blood to the vein that was bleeding and \u201chope it holds",
  "\u201d  I had a lot of faith in her, so I simply said, \u201cOK",
  "\u201d The next morning they took me to the operating room, almost 26 weeks along and I got the epidural",
  " I signed a release and in I went",
  "  She, along with her partner, were going to perform this procedure- he wasn\u2019t as keen on the idea",
  " In fact, he said to me, \u201cthis is very risky- you could die",
  "\u201d  I still felt in my gut that it would be OK",
  "  Shortly into the procedure, I started to hemorrhage, received 5 units of blood, heard lots of cursing between the Doctors, then, it was over",
  " The suture was tied",
  " I said, \u201cdid it work",
  "\u201d  My Doctor simply replied, \u201cit\u2019s tied",
  "\u201d  Back to my room I went, where I sat for many more days until I was finally sent home at 28 weeks with strict rules to eat a lot of red meat, and stay in bed- strict bed rest-literally, don\u2019t move",
  " I was also told that if I started to bleed and the suture untied, as the babies continued to grow, that added pressure would cause an immediate hemorrhage",
  "   Therefore, I was also sent home with directions to give the paramedic if this were to happen",
  " This was tough",
  " It was scary",
  " My body, quickly transformed into something unrecognizable",
  " Gaining  78lbs of weight, water, and baby, I was a wreck, physically",
  " I hadn\u2019t walked in the past several weeks- I even had a day where I was rushed to the hospital with concern of a blood clot as my leg swelled up extremely large",
  " Luckily, it wasn\u2019t, but over the course of the next several weeks, I had a variety of problems from rashes to serious edema, premature contractions, and ultimately, I developed a cold and a fever just before delivery at 36",
  "5 weeks when the Doctor finally said, we have to go in and take these babies, now",
  " However, that suture never broke",
  " It ultimately kept the babies alive- and me",
  " The vein was cauterized during the C section and I wouldn\u2019t ever have to worry again",
  " After another week in the hospital, I was sent home",
  " With my newborn twins, along with an absolutely exhausted husband, we all went home",
  " It was us, and them",
  " My body was shot- I could barely walk, my knees couldn\u2019t bend well, and I was swollen and so large I could barely recognize myself",
  " My once sylph-like ballet body had transformed into something that resembled  nothing short of the marshmallow man; I also had a long line of staples going straight down my abdomen ",
  "   I had left my business in May and didn\u2019t return to teaching there until October",
  " Finances were tough;  I had to pay everyone working to keep my school going while I was out and I didn\u2019t have any money to pay myself",
  " We were just at our breaking point when finally, I was well enough to return to work and worked like hell to get financial control back of my studio",
  " During that time, I also had to rehabilitate my body which had turned into a completely foreign object",
  " Thankfully, my knowledge of Pilates permitted me to do this via many weeks of dedication and slow progression",
  " Somehow, I made it through",
  " My business was once again, thriving and growing and I felt even more empowered for having made it through our unfortunate situation",
  " Almost four years down the road, and well on our way to more adventure, we were hit with our second round of adversity",
  " My husband, who had been diagnosed years prior with Crohn\u2019s Disease suffered a complicated Crohn\u2019s induced ruptured appendix",
  " The twins were just shy of four years old and I was finally back to feeling like me again after my horrific pregnancy",
  "  The studio was thriving",
  "  This episode resulted in three hospital transfers, multiple surgeries and finally Sepsis and escalation to the ICU",
  " During the procedures to fix the ruptured appendix, he also suffered a bowel perforation which caused a bowel leak, ultimately leading to a bowel resection and a temporary ostomy",
  " During these serious life threatening situations, I was forced to turn my school over to the hands of my amazing staff as I cared for my extremely ill husband who ended up requiring home nursing and constant care for a few months",
  " Grateful to have my husband alive, here we were again in the same predicament, only this time it was much worse",
  " My husband was out of work for a year as he healed from his surgeries and then had to have another surgery to reverse the ostomy",
  " I had to hire a full time assistant to run my business",
  " I was working as much as I could in between caring for him and the twins, but all of our money was once again going to pay others to keep our doors open",
  " Needless to say, I don\u2019t know how, but we recovered, and I went on to enjoy another four years of business ownership- they were the most profitable and the most rewarding years I had the pleasure of owning my school, I even expanded it one last time",
  " When I made the decision to sell, it wasn\u2019t in my original plan",
  " Once again I had to rely on my intuition",
  " Shortly before Christmas in 2015, when putting my daughter to bed I asked her what she wanted most from Santa",
  " She replied \u201cI want Mommy to get rid of her studio",
  "\u201d It hit me like a brick",
  " It was clear and there was no confusion in the message I needed to receive",
  " My children- especially my daughter- needed my presence",
  " My life, up to that point, had been about growing and developing my studio",
  " Our family had faced medical adversity, the business had been built and rebuilt- each time stronger, and now it was time for me to put that same energy where it belonged, toward my children",
  " Needless to say, in 2016 I sold the dance studio, only maintaining my Pilates business, and just like that, that part of my story was over and I was onto a new chapter",
  " I never looked back",
  " When I reflect on my life so far, I try to find understanding with regard to each turn, new path and new opportunity",
  " The truth is, I feel I\u2019ve been given so many beautiful opportunities",
  " If it weren\u2019t for my ability to listen to my intuition, my grit to put in whatever it takes to succeed- and at times, just get by, along with moments, months, and on occasion-years of adversity to shake things up- I wouldn\u2019t have taken those opportunities, or survived the bumps along the way",
  " Each year I\u2019ve found a way to create and re-create when necessary, a balance to my life to keep me courageous and hungry for what life has to offer, but ultimately, relying on optimism and intuition to point me in the right direction",
  " I\u2019ve learned, somehow, I always end up right where I\u2019m supposed to be",
  " During this recital/performance  season, I\u2019ve seen a lot of posts on social media about many stressed out, tired, studio directors",

  "I have suffered with mental illness for most of my life starting with self harm and depression at the age of 14 which then led to anorexia in my 20&#8217;s and later being diagnosed with bipolar disorder",
  " I have had 6 hospital admissions and been through the system and experiences NHS and private care as well as crisis teams feeling like there was no hope and I was never going to get well",
  " I dropped out of the NHS system for 4 years at one point due to being told by psychiatrists that &#8220;self harm is childs play&#8221; and another shortly after wanting to end my life that my problem was that my life was &#8220;boring empty and pointless&#8221; despite having experienced what I now know to be a manic episode with psychotic features and showing him a private assessment report with a bipolar diagnosis that he ignored and when he was challenged later that week by my partner walked out of the room",
  "I now want to raise awareness not only on mental health and encourage others to speak out and know that they are not alone but also about treatment and gaps that I still know exist in the system and people who&#8217;s stories I still hear online that are still getting poor treatment that really does in some circumstances have the potential to make or take a life",
  " I have had negative experiences with crisis teams also, whereby after telling them of thoughts I was having regarding ending my life by jumping in front of a train and that I had been thinking about doing it and the thoughts that I had been having to be told to &#8220;contact them if it got any worse&#8221; I think it is so important to raise awareness of the importance that crisis teams have to play in saving lives and that conversations like this have to be taken seriously",
  " After a long battle from age 14 to my last hospital admission privately in 2016 which changed everything for me just because I was listened to and treated accordingly which could have happened so much sooner and potentially saved so much pain, I finally started to get better and now wok hard to share my story and raise awareness on mental health",
  " It really highlighted to me what a difference good treatment can make and this shouldn&#8217;t be exclusive only to those that have private insurance or a lot of money",

  " I have also written a book about my experiences that I wanted to be very raw, honest with no heirs and graces including diary entries spanning years from experiencing depression, self harm, anorexia and psychosis as well as highlighting the treatment system and where and why I think some things need to be improved which is available on Amazon hereI want others to know that even though it can feel impossible, things really can change and to give yourself time",

  "Dedication: Kath Sansom, founder of Sling The Mesh campaign",
  " \rWithout Kath i would be none the wiser that the pelvic mesh surgery I had in 2006 was the reason for my excruciating chronic pain, lack of mobility and  infections",
  "My life is never going to be how it should be",
  "My story begins in 2006, I had a TVT mesh implant procedure after many years of suffering with stress urinary incontinence due to the births of my three children",
  " I believed my surgeon when she told me that the procedure was very safe and came with only minor risks that were associated with all surgeries",
  " My surgeon failed to tell me that complications such as giant cell foreign body response, chronic inflammation, painful intercourse, nerve pain and urge incontinence would impair my life forever",
  "I was a fit and healthy 38 year old women",
  " I was enjoying my life; in fact, life was great",
  " I had a fab hubby and three children, two sons and a daughter, who I was very proud of",
  " I had a job that I loved, working in a secondary school as a learning support teaching assistant, supporting students in lessons",
  "During my follow up appointment with my doctor, after the mesh surgery, I mentioned that I had been suffering from pelvic pain, pain during intercourse and had developed severe urge incontinence",
  " I was told that I was still healing and needed to give my body more time",
  "Within a year of having the Mesh surgery the stress urinary incontinence reappeared, and I also had ongoing urinary tract infections, especially after sexual intercourse",
  " My Doctor suggested the infections were due to me not being clean, and that I should shower before and after sexual intercourse",
  " I felt embarrassed and humiliated at what my Doctor had said",
  " I&#8217;d never had UTI Infections until after Mesh surgery ",
  "I actually lost count of the number of times I had to attend the Urogynaecology department of my local hospital between 2006 and 2017",
  " It became like a home from home, to such an extent that I was on first name terms with the nurses",
  " When I checked in for appointments I would joke that I was there again",
  "Over the next few years I had to have numerous urodynamic tests",
  " Two tubes are placed into the bladder, one that tests pressure and the other which enables saline to be pumped into the bladder",
  " Then the bit which I always dreaded the most: a tube up my back passage",
  " It\u2019s just embarrassing, isn\u2019t it",
  " Invasive and slightly humiliating, no matter how nice the doctor or nurse is",
  "After the tubes were  placed, the nurse would take some baseline measurements of my pressures, which were shown on a computer screen",
  " Then she\u2019d ask me to cough whilst standing over an incontinence sheet (coughing, it turnedout, was a key part of the urodynamics",
  ") This proved that my stress incontinence had returned",
  "In a follow-up appointment the consultant gave me some options, one being more surgery to put in another Mesh product called a TVTO",
  " This would sit on top of the TVT or I was offered Botox injections which are injected into the bladder",
  " Botox is used to treat Overactive bladder symptoms, Urge incontinence and Stress urinary incontinence",
  " I opted for the Botox, and went on to have the injections four times in six years",
  " Each time you have to have  a general anaesthetic for the procedure to be performed in an operating theatre",
  "I also developed excruciating pains in my lower back, hips, groin, legs and feet along with pins and needles, patchy numbness and altered sensation",
  " My GP referred me to see a pain consultant, who diagnosed me with peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage)",
  " I was investigated for Multiple sclerosis and a brain tumour",
  " All these tests came back as normal  and the Doctor commented that it was \u201cunusual\u201d not to know the reason why I had these symptoms",
  " The treatment for my pain was powerful opioid drugs, and I was told that I would \u201chave to live with the pain\u201d",
  "I was now  unable to do normal things without debilitating pain and fatigue",
  " I dragged myself to work each day, and at the weekends I was bedridden",
  " I was unable to do normal things such as shopping, housework, and walking my dog",
  "By chance one day I was watching the Victoria Derbyshire television programme and caught a discussion about mesh surgery complications",
  " Kath Sansom, founder of the Sling The Mesh campaign group, was talking about pelvic mesh and the associated complications",
  " This was my lightbulb moment",
  " I realised that this could be the reason for my eleven yearsof pain and  illness",
  "I joined the Sling The Mesh Facebook group whose members now total 7,600 and chatted with other members whose symptoms were very similar to mine",
  " I learnt that mesh is made from  polypropylene plastic \u2013 the same material used to make drinks bottles and garden furniture",
  " Mesh can attach and slice through organs, causing chronic pain, sepsis, loss of sex life, and even organ failure",
  "Searching through the group\u2019s files I came across information about a Urogynaecologist called Suzy Elneil, who was helping women with mesh complications",
  " I made an appointment to see Doctor Elneil, which meant traveling 200 miles away from my home",
  " She confirmed my symptoms were probably related to the mesh",
  "In 2018 I had two mesh removal surgeries, which also included vaginal and urethral repairs due to the damage from the mesh",
  " The surgeries are very complex, as removing the mesh is likened to \u201cremoving bubble gum from hair",
  "\u201d After my second removal surgery I became unwell, and spent two days in intensive care, as well as needing to stay in hospital for three weeks to recover",
  "Due to the mesh damage, I have now been left with lasting pudendal/obturator and femoral nerve damage",
  "Living with a chronic condition can be debilitating; both physically and mentally",
  " I can feel worthless and a burden to my family, and I have a myriad of intense and long-lasting feelings \u2013 everything from exhaustion to fear to guilt because of the demands made on my family",
  "Building a new life is a challenge, but connecting with other women who are dealing with similar symptoms and struggles eases the loneliness",
  " This is why Sling The Mesh is so important to me; as an admin on the Facebook group I can offer love and support to others",
  " My life has changed direction since Mesh but I tell myself to make the most of it, to live and exist in this very moment, chase my dreams and fight for my happiness",
  " This is also why I took part in protests in Manchester and London on Thursday 9 May 2019",
  " We were  protesting against new health guidelines published in April 2019 by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)",
  " We are also fighting to keep open a specialist NHS mesh removal service in London, after it was stopped with no prior warning",
  " Some operations were cancelled by hospital chiefs just days before women were due to receive complex mesh removal surgery \u2013 some of whom had waited up to two years for surgery",
  "Our protest was about standing up for women whose lives have been torn apart by mesh",
  " Manufactures want profit, their prime concern is not the wellbeing of women",
  " We have to stand up for ourselves",
  " This is not just a UK problem it affects women around the globe",
  " During July 2018 , Mesh for stress urinary incontinence was suspended in hospitals across England after a Government safety team found its causes life changing and life threatening injuries",
  "The UK now has a suspension of vaginal Mesh",
  "In April 2019 the Indian government was considering stopping the sale of pelvic surgical Mesh",
  "Also in the same month the FDA ordered all manufacturers of surgical Mesh intended for transvaginal repair and prolapse to stop selling and distributing their products",
  "There are lawsuits in the UK, Canada , US and AustraliaMore than 100, 000 transvaginal Mesh lawsuits have been filed in the US , with the manufacturer of the most commonly used Mesh, Johnson &amp; Johnson , facing the lawsuits",
  "The Australian government issued a national apology to women affected by the Vaginal Mesh scandal, acknowledging decades of &#8221; agony and pain&#8221;",
  "Sling the mesh wants Mesh to be banned",
  " If this is not possible then we would like Women to try a range of techniques before Mesh is considered",
  "  We recommend a range of non-surgical options first such as lifestyle changes and pelvic floor training",
  " Sling The Mesh continues to offer support, love and advice to its 7",
  "6k members",

  " A girl that grew up in a place that can only be compared to hell",
  " A girl who got pregnant at 16 and just maybe got married at 18",
  " When I was a little girl I had so many dreams of being beautiful, wanted, and loved",
  " But as I got older the dreams faded and my imagination faltered",
  " I started pushing through every day with one goal",
  " Survive",
  " My mom hated me",
  " She beat me constantly, and when she wasn\u2019t she was too checked out on her computer to notice me",
  " My dad loved me too much, enough that I was the only one whose room he didn\u2019t sneak into at night",
  " That made my siblings hate me",
  " I wasn\u2019t old enough to understand that",
  " On my 9th birthday I had a rude awakening",
  " My mom never acknowledged me on my birthday and my siblings gave me birthday punches every year",
  " I decided to go on a bike ride to cheer myself up",
  " There was a bayou on the other side of the neighborhood that would grow flowers all through summer",
  " I ended spending the whole day there drawing flowers and celebrating my birthday by myself",
  " I stayed out until the sun started going down",
  " I remember crossing the bridge going towards the neighborhood and feeling this hole in my stomach",
  " Like I knew something wasn\u2019t right",
  " I ignored it and just walked alongside my bike",
  " I was about 5 minutes away from being home when a man walked up to me",
  " He asked me if I could help him with something in his garage",
  " I told him no and I kept walking",
  " He followed and said that he needed someone with small hands because his were too big",
  " I told him no again, this time climbing on my bike to get away from him faster",
  " That\u2019s when he hit me in the head",
  " I remember waking up dizzy and in pain",
  " I was face down and could see my own blood in a small puddle on the concrete",
  " I fought with everything I had and I got away",
  " I ran home",
  " I don\u2019t remember what time it was when I got back",
  " I know my mom was still awake with a single lamp illuminating her desk",
  " When I walked inside she didn\u2019t even notice me",
  " I took a shower and went to bed and that was that",
  " My siblings never knew, my parents never knew",
  " But I knew from that day on that I was alone",
  " Me, myself, and I against the entire world",
  " And I was okay with that",
  " As I got older I made bad decision after bad decision",
  " I got addicted to cocaine, I struggled with an eating disorder and depression since that birthday",
  " I had abusive boyfriends, bad influences for friends, and a family that didn\u2019t notice me",
  " The only person who did was this girl named Sophie",
  " I made friends with Sophie when I was 8",
  " Sophie was this weird, crazy, sweet, funny, girl that walked up to me one day at church and said that she wanted to be my friend",
  " So we became friends",
  " That Sunday I went over to her house",
  " I met her two brothers",
  " David and Michael",
  " David was the oldest and I think when we met I was 8 and he was 12",
  " And I thought he was the cutest guy I had ever seen",
  " A couple years passed with me and Sophie being the best of friends, and me turning into a drugged out party girl",
  " In 2016 she invited me over for a whole weekend while her parents were away and David took this time to make his move on me",
  " We played truth or dare and the entire time we were flirting with each other",
  " But David was different than the other guys that I had pursued or that had pursued me",
  " He was almost too shy to really flirt with me",
  " So after that weekend we would text in secret and meet up for nighttime walks together",
  " That went on from the spring of 2016 until the fall of the same year",
  " I had just been released from the second behavioral hospital I was admitted into",
  " It was thanksgiving and Sophie had already invited me to dinner with her family and a sleepover after",
  " We went to her aunt and uncles house",
  " Her, David, and I were in the guest room just talking and hanging out with each other",
  " David and I were sneaking glances and blushing cheeks and touches the entire time",
  " At some point after dinner me and David were alone in the guest room and he kissed me for the first time",
  " I remember I completely froze and my entire face turned bright red",
  " After that we started hanging out in secret more and more",
  " At this point I had lost my virginity willingly a long time ago and I was expecting David to want me in that way",
  " But he never pushed for it",
  " He showed me love",
  " I can\u2019t say that I had ever seen or felt it before because David gave me the purest kind of love that I think exists",
  " He told me that he loved me, I didn\u2019t say it back",
  " Not until he proposed",
  " That night that he got down on one knee I said it back and I\u2019ve never seen someone look so happy",
  " He ignited my imagination and gave me the ability to dream again",
  " We dreamt of driving all around the USA and seeing everything there is to see",
  " And then I got pregnant",
  " Everything turned upside down but he stood by me",
  " He told me that we would get married as soon as I turned 18 and that he would always be there for me",
  " 2018 came around and I had just given birth to our beautiful son",
  " Then my grandma kicked us out",
  " We ran to the only place we could",
  " David\u2019s parents",
  " Something to know about his parents is that David and Sophie\u2019s mom never liked me",
  " Even when I was still young and playing with Sophie",
  " They took us in and told us they would help us and that they would let us grow",
  " Everything seemed ok",
  " Then things started unraveling",
  " They started taking everything they could from us",
  " Money for rent made sense but the food that we bought would end up in their bellies, the \u201cfancy\u201d soap bar that cost 2 dollars more than the generic ended up cleaning their bodies",
  " When I confronted them they claimed it was \u201ctheir fault for telling us to be comfortable",
  "\u201d Resentment grew",
  " I started working two jobs to be able to get my family out",
  " Nothing worked",
  " Price of living is too high and we had no credit or rental history",
  " No one would let us move in anywhere",
  " At this point David and I were already married and our son was a year old",
  " I was tired, frustrated, and my hope started draining",
  " When I found out that my in laws were asking my family where me and David were at or what our plan was I was infuriated",
  " David begged me not to confront them but I did",
  " I asked them to stop texting and calling my dad to find things out about us",
  " My father in law said no and that the fact I would ask that showed how naive and immature I am",
  " I told him that asking my dad these questions was a waste of time because my dad doesn\u2019t know anything",
  " My father in law asked why not",
  " I told him that I didn\u2019t believe that he or my in laws needed to know anything",
  " My father in law responded with a simple \u201cyou have a lot of growing up to do",
  "\u201d At this point I was crying and fuming at work",
  " I had thrown my phone down in anger and walked away from the text conversation",
  " My mother in law chimed in saying that me and David don\u2019t know how to accept someone else\u2019s wisdom and that we needed to grow up and listen",
  " So I responded with thank you for your concern",
  " In hindsight that was the wrong thing to say",
  " But I honestly didn\u2019t think anything of it",
  " I saw it as a way to end the conversation",
  " My mother in law took it as an F you",
  " Now my mother in law in my opinion is abusive",
  " I\u2019ve seen her hit her other son Michael, refuse to feed her children what was in the fridge or pantry because she needed it for some recipe that she never made, tell her children that they couldn\u2019t achieve anything whenever they brought up something about what they wanted for the future, and make her husband get rid of all the things for his hobbies because she didn\u2019t think she was getting enough attention",
  " On top of that, whenever she or my father in law would care for my son he would always end up with bruises or cuts or extremely dirty and exhausted because someone had dropped him, they weren\u2019t paying attention to where he was, and refused to follow our schedule for him because she thought she knew what was best for my son",
  " Anyway, when I got home after the text conversation my in laws told me and the rest of the family (David, Michael and our son) to sit down for a family meeting",
  " As soon as I sat down my mother in law started beating on me telling me that I didn\u2019t know how to accept love, that she was mortified by my behavior, that I wasn\u2019t doing anything to push my family forward",
  " I got frustrated because she wouldn\u2019t let me speak so I told her to stop talking so that I could",
  " My father in law who is 6 foot 11 stood over me and started yelling at me",
  " I was launched into an anxiety attack, I sat there silently as they told me that I\u2019ve failed and that I need to grow up and that I need to stop making people feel sorry for me and that all they were doing was treating me like an adult",
  " That wasn\u2019t the worst part though",
  " What hurt even more was watching David sit there",
  " His head down refusing to make eye contact with me",
  " He could hear everything they were saying, see what they were doing and he did nothing to help me",
  " At one point my mother in law said that because I married David I had to change myself to work with his family",
  " I was enraged I took my wedding ring off and threw it at David",
  " I stormed out and as I opened the door my mother in law told me that if I walked out then I couldn\u2019t come back",
  " I slammed the door behind me and started trying to compose myself",
  " David ran after me",
  " I screamed at him trying to understand how he could let them do that to me",
  " He told me that there wasn\u2019t anything he could\u2019ve done and that he didn\u2019t know what to do",
  " I sat on the curb while he went to get our car and an overnight bag",
  " My dad took us in and now we live in a dining room",
  " There were a couple of weeks that I thought of leaving my husband, because how can someone like me who has been beaten down her entire life be with someone who promised to protect her and then break that promise",
  " We\u2019re doing better now",
  " I have a good job, David\u2019s gonna go to school, and our son is healthy and smart",
  " I just want everyone, girls and boys, to know that yeah your life can be completely awful",

  " I found mine in a baby and a wonderful man who takes care of me",

  " I still tell myself that this is the picture of winning and not whining",
  " What a crock",
  " I am by the way seven months in",
  " Occasionally I have the leisure of stroking my ego with my daily intakes and detailed notification of how to frustrate the alien\u2019s happy hour",

  " So I refrain from stretching  my energy any further and conserve it for the final battle, so I think to myself",
  " Definitely energy has not defected or has it",
  " Both of us were hand in hand, dancing at the creation of this new cell that has now evolved to complex organism with a coding system that even I am incapable of deciphering",
  " Despite of my sophisticated and stalwart background in computational schema, I am at my knees again and this time I can clearly see my strong will is adapting to a submarine temperament",

  " The very instant that I was celebrating as a guest of honor, I was actually witnessing my will being enthralled and incubated as fusion was taking place",
  " So all the excitement, pats on my back and thinking to myself that I am winning were a total mirage",
  " This includes efforts indulging my ego by investing in sleepiness nights searching through library materials of ways to regain control of my organs",
  " This too was frivolous",
  " I have been duped by an alien whose schema is far advanced yet I had the home court advantage",
  " Now as I lie here starring at the scalpel with no fear, I surrender and I raise high my white flag",
  " As my thoughts attempt to race and my breathing becomes more faint, all I can repeat are these words; the alien\u2019s Will has prevailed and I have seceded with no alliance or allegiance of my own organ systems rather a shadow of invariable deductions&#8230;My eyes struggle to focus on a glimmer of light from a distance and the voices around lack cohesion",

  " But there came a point where things changed and sometimes he touched my hand in a certain way, or touched my shoulders, even if I had my phone in my pocket he would get his hand and take out my phone, when it came to paying me the money sometimes he expected me to be scrubbing for him to go and put the money in my pocket, but the way he did it was very inappropriate, he tried to touch me while doing it, he said very inappropriate things to me, he even gave opinions about my private life",

  " Obviously needing lab work, doctor\u2019s visits and everything else medical that goes along with the first trimester of being pregnant, I needed to figure out my insurance gap",

  "00 a month",
  " What could I do though",

  " Welp",
  "",
  " there goes a little over 2 grand",
  " The rest of my pregnancy, while I was insured was filled with normal co-payments and global fees and other lab charges that were expected, but it was not until after my baby was born that I was truly annoyed",
  "The entire pregnancy, co-workers kept asking, \u201cHave you looked up daycares",
  "\u201d \u201cWhich one do you like",
  "\u201d \u201cWhich one is closer to your husband\u2019s job\u201d \u201cAre you going to pump",
  "\u201d \u201cThis is the formula I used\u2026\u201d And honestly, it made me sick",
  " Growing up, being the oldest of 8 children, my mom always stayed home, while dad went to work, and honestly certain things were tight, but mostly it worked out very well; having two distinct roles",
  " Mom handles household\u2026 dad funds household",
  " But\u2026 seeing that growing up, I guess it became my norm, so I never grew up saying, \u201cGod\u2026 I cannot wait to have kids so I can throw them in daycare with formula all week and go be a career woman",
  "\u201dAs I got older, I did end up going to school",
  " Took me 6 years to graduate from a community college, but I got my degree and I was debt free",
  " I chose nursing because I love being depended on\u2026 I love when people come to me for advice and I love watching people overcome battles",
  " I also chose nursing because of the shifts and vast working environments I had to choose from",
  " After school, I did sign up for an online curriculum to obtain my Bachelor\u2019s, since it is almost a requirement at this point to be hired; I put myself on a payment plan, which luckily saved me from racking up any interest, and I can happily say that I obtained my second degree, also debt free",
  "Anyway\u2026 as my pregnancy continued, I maintained my full-time job and online curriculum",
  " I worked up until I was 41 weeks and 3 days pregnant",
  " For those who have been pregnant before, I am sure you can imagine my fatigue",
  " Waking up, operating on people for 8 hours\u2026 going home and writing 8 page papers and then having to worry about cooking, cleaning, showering and the 20 thousand toilet trips to pee all day; I can honestly say, I have never been that worn in my life",
  " But to continue \u2026 16 days after my due date, I finally gave birth my baby boy",
  " What a whirlwind of emotions; there were places in my heart woke that I never knew existed, and just when I thought I could not love anything or anyone more than I had loved my son, the next day would come along, and I loved him even more",
  " It was almost uncomfortable; this bond between a mother and baby",
  " As the love grew, it became apparent to me that I was not okay with leaving him for any longer than his nap times",
  " Panic started to set in; how will I go to work\u2026 I do not trust those daycares\u2026 I just want to nurse my baby\u2026 I cannot and will not leave him",
  "It actually made me sick",
  " 6 weeks is all they would give me",
  " 42 days",
  " After growing him for 42 weeks and pushing him out, 42 days was all I was given to get my baby acclimated to the environment, get on a sleeping schedule, maintain my leaking and sore breasts on an unnatural pumping schedule, create a bond and then mentally prepare myself for separation",
  " (Just to put things in perspective for you: most dog breeders do not even sell off their puppies until they are at least 8 weeks old, yet here I am, a woman \u2013 a human\u2026 and I am supposed to drop my flesh and blood off to some institution for hours on end, while I \u201cget back to work\u201d)",
  " Oh don\u2019t worry ladies\u2026 all the daycares have video cameras and you receive text logs about your child\u2019s days now, it\u2019s like your right there with them",
  " \uf0df that was sarcasm by the way",
  " For me, I could not do it",
  " I would stare at my baby and cry hysterics just thinking about leaving him with anyone; even if Jesus himself resurrected, I would still rather the baby be with me",
  " Realizing our financial situation, I knew that my family did rely on my income for comfort, so it came with a tremendous amount of guilt when I asked my husband if we could make it without me going to work",
  " For me, there are more important things than financial comfort",
  " I know some moms have their parents that are able to babysit, other moms have great trust in daycares, some hire nannies, other moms work from home, some women are just housewives; moral of the story, there are hundreds of different scenarios",
  " Nobody said having a baby would be easy and from experience, I can say that having a baby is not the hard part, but it\u2019s the decisions that need to be made afterwards",
  "Because of today\u2019s society, the norm being a household with 2 incomes; my hopes and dreams of what I wanted for a family, are almost unattainable, and I am sure I am not alone in this thought",
  " Because of my education, because of my \u201cadult\u201d status, because of the financial requirements to have anything these days, I am being robbed",
  " Robbed of a vision that I wanted for myself and for my family",
  "To tie everything together, women are to be blamed for this robbery",
  " The women who fought so hard for our \u201cequal\u201d opportunity",
  " This freedom that is given to us has taken away from a true virtue",
  " It is almost impossible for a middleclass woman to stay home with her children",
  " The ironic part about all of this, is that these women are always speaking about \u201cempowerment\u201d",
  " You want to know what is empowering",
  " Being a mother\u2026 being there for your kids\u2026 watching them grow and knowing that you had an active role in shaping who they are and everything they know\u2026 But, today\u2019s age, people are not consumed with this empowerment",
  " Empowerment today revolves around materialistic things, busy schedules, who is more tired, who goes on more vacations, how many times one hits the gym, who has the better posts online, ect",
  " I am unsure of when empowerment became such a measurable, shallow aspect in life, but it seems that bonds between mothers and children are becoming less important and even less attainable in today\u2019s world",
  " For me, this is sad",
  "After deciding to not return to work right away, I received a slew of comments from all angles",
  " \u201cYou are wasting your education",
  "\u201d \u201cYou can work nights",
  "\u201d \u201cYour husband cannot do this without you",
  "\u201d \u201cYour brain will turn to mush",
  "\u201d \u201cWho are you doing this for",
  "\u201dAs a new mom, I can say I was not the most confident person, so these comments were taken harshly",
  " I questioned my every move, I put myself in very dark places at night when all I had was thinking time, I felt guilt every time a bill came in the mail, but one thing I never questioned: I always felt I was doing the 100% right thing for my baby and that was the ultimate goal- the reason for all of my decisions",
  "Another fun fact about my journey\u2026 since I did not return to work, the baby was never put on my insurance that I had during birth and for the six weeks of leave",
  " Since I did not return to work, the baby was not covered, therefore we were left with all of the medical expenses",
  " How is this fair",
  " I worked up until passed my due date, full time and gave birth in the hospital I worked at",
  " Luckily, there was a deduction because of my employment status at the time of birth, but I just do not understand how this is fair",
  " This also added to the anguish I endured inside my thoughts about my life decisions post-partum",
  "Luckily, I was able to find insurance for me and the baby, as hubby\u2019s job\u2019s plans were almost laughable",
  " I was in shock that such plans even existed and were offered",
  " Shopping for insurance, sending every document relating to income and organizing the doctor\u2019s bills took about three months",
  " Three months of my time\u2026 every time the baby napped I was on the phone; Every morning I woke up, I was checking emails and bill statuses; Every night I would cry and stress out about the debt that seemed so crazy to me",
  " I just did not understand how he was not covered, but I was during the birth; I feel like this should be illegal as it does not make sense",
  " If the mother is covered, why would the baby not automatically be assumed to need health insurance after being born",
  "As time goes on, I still receive comments about my working status and questions about our financial situation and my decisions",
  " I can say that at this point, I am still not 100% comfortable with my life, but I am 100% happy",
  " My baby is 8 months now and although we have our struggles, we cannot enjoy regular date nights, our savings accounts had to be put to use and I am constantly couponing and negotiating between needs and wants, I have figured a way to make it work",
  " Sometimes I sit back and an overwhelming feeling of guilt will sweep over me \uf0e0 I should get back to work, I need to start pitching in, we do not have to live this simply \uf0e0 but then I look over in the living room and see my baby playing with his toys, being comfortable in his environment, chasing his dog, getting to nap when he wants in his bed, getting to be comforted by his mother during the day, going on daily walks in his carriage and ultimately just being in his element, and it makes me realize that I am not doing this for me, I am doing this for him and I should not feel guilty for putting my son first and what I think is best",
  " Society has an inevitably annoying way of putting ideas of how things should be and it honestly takes a toll on people",
  " Slowly but surely, I am growing more confident as a mother, wife, homemaker and as MYSELF; which is important\u2026 sometimes loosing yourself is the easiest thing to do when you are being pulled in so many directions",
  "Being an empowered woman has many definitions",
  " Having 101 things to do during the day can be empowering",
  " But being happy and making what YOU want work is also fulfilling, so I am making the bed I want to sleep in and prioritizing for the present",
  " I am not working, so guess what\u2026 we probably won\u2019t get approved for a mortgage",
  " I probably cannot get that pedicure, or that shirt\u2026 or go on that vacation",
  " But while I am renting and my husband works a couple hours of overtime each week, I do get the peace of mind everyday that my child is safe under MY supervision\u2026 when he wakes up 2 or 3x during the night, I am not angry and viciously doing subtraction to see how many minutes of sleep I have left for the night\u2026 when he gets sick, I am there to take care of him\u2026 everyday, I am reading to him, rocking him and playing with him",
  " The housework is no longer put on the backburner, but rather kept up with every day, the way I want it",
  "Getting to spend money without thought is a luxury that some people have\u2026 but why does spending time with your child also have to be a luxury",
  " It\u2019s a God-given right; people should not have to \u201cmake it work\u201d or \u201csuffer\u201d just because they want to spend time with their kids&#8230; but the harsh reality of today\u2019s society is that the norm has become mom AND dad go to work AND baby gets taken care of by relatives or daycares",
  "I wrote this to get things off of my chest and to read it out loud",
  " Sometimes saying it out loud makes things easier to process",
  " Anyway\u2026 as a once working woman, I can say that I did feel empowered, especially in my scrubs, at the end of each shift I left with a smile and seeing a difference is people\u2019s lives really made the 12 hour shifts so rewarding, I will never regret becoming a nurse, and I will always keep up on my licenses and requirements as I do plan to get back to work one day\u2026 but I have never been so content in my life than I am with my son",
  " I can honestly say that I am a calmer/ better person\u2026 he is what I needed",
  " I was going 100mph everyday \uf0e0 school, work",

  " doctor appointments",
  "",
  " pee pee pee\u2026 more school",

  " more work\u2026 trying to clean, oh shit, I need to eat today",

  " Switches were flipped that I didn\u2019t know where there\u2026 other switches that were always there were turned off and before I knew it, within a few short weeks, I noticed a complete shift in my priorities and even how I thought",
  " I was a changed woman",
  " And then I suddenly started acted different too",
  " It was no longer, \u201cUgh I have to do laundry\u201d, it was, \u201cWow, thank God I have this washing machine and dryer\u2026 Ill do laundry today while the baby naps",

  "\u201d I mean\u2026 I can keep going, but I think you all get the picture",
  " I was much happier\u2026 calmer\u2026 I wasn\u2019t so concerned with what time it was or what I \u201cHAD\u201d to do, but rather what I \u201cGOT\u201d to do",
  "I understand not all women feel the same, some women enjoy working and some women just do not like to \u201csit in the house\u201d\u2026 But I can say, for me, a once full time nurse, I am loving this little piece of my life, or maybe I am loving this little piece of my son\u2019s life",
  " I would not trade any nursing session, poop up the back diaper, walk, book reading, or watching him crawl and annoy the dog all day for any ounce of work experience",
  " That is just not where my head is",
  " When he is more independent (no longer breastfeeding, walking, talking), I might feel more comfortable getting back into the working world\u2026 but for now, I am thoroughly enjoying all these roses bestowed around me that I never took a minute to smell before",
  "Its sad that not all women feel that they have this option, (the option to take care of their baby) because as mentioned before\u2026 it is SO hard to be a functioning one income household, but pregnancy is 9 or 10 months long depending on when you find out\u2026 there are ways to consolidate debt and come up with a plan",
  " My husband is not educated and the job he works does not pay the best, plus we got stuck with all those medical bills",
  " It was a tricky situation, but we did eventually figure it out\u2026 I also had always planned to go back to work until I actually had my baby in my arms\u2026 so we were not prepared at all",

  " It was also nice to put a name to the way I was feeling",
  " She then prescribed me medication to help with my symptoms",
  " The hard part was waiting for it to kick in",
  "",
  " while I was waiting for my Ned&#8217;s to kick in I just got worse and worse to the point where I was trying anything just to feel better",
  " I was abusing alcohol and was taking any kind of pill I could find to mess me up so I didn&#8217;t have to feel anymore",
  " On one occasion I took so many pills I couldn&#8217;t walk nor talk right and my parents had to rush me to the hospital",
  " Thankfully I didn&#8217;t have to get my stomach pumped I only had to drink liquid charcoal which was absolutely disgusting",
  " It had finally been a month and the pills were supposed to be kicking in",
  " Nothing yet",
  " I still felt incredibly sad and disgusted with my appearance that I would lash out so badly at my parents that a couple times I punched my mom in the nose resulting in her having black eyes and my parents then calling the cops on me&#8230; my parents had no idea what to do or how to make me better",
  " So we had my medication switched over to something else to see if that may work",
  " In the course of me waiting to see if this medication would take effect I once again took way to many pills and could not speak or walk",
  " My sister was the only one home and seeing as she couldn&#8217;t drive she had to call the ambulance to take me to the hospital",
  " And again I had to drink liquid chRcoal",
  "I&#8217;ll never forget the amount of tears my sister cried",
  " That alone killed me",
  " As my sister never cried",
  " Looking back on this I really wasn&#8217;t trying to commit suicide but Ithinking about it I was actually okay with the thought of dieing",
  " I would finally be at peace",
  " By grade 10 I was starting to feel better",
  " My pills had finally started to work people had started to stop the bullying I had finally gotten a boyfriend",
  " But me having that certain boyfriend came with a lot of backlash from other people",
  " This guy had an ex girlfriend who didn&#8217;t want me any where near him",
  " So again we are back to the mental abuse",
  " I was getting told I was anorexic the next day I would get told I&#8217;m too fat the next day I was too ugly to have a boyfriend and it eventually got to the point of death threats every time I walked through the halls from multiple people",
  " It was a nightmare",
  " When I told my mom about what was happening she immediately went to the principal to voice her concerns",
  " But the principal said it was just kids being kids there was nothing she could do",
  " My mother was furious",
  " Her child was getting death threats and making her daughter severely depressed once again and no one would help",
  " She felt horrible",
  " But after about a year of that me and this boyfriend broke up and eventually it all subsided",
  " No more death threats no more bullying",
  " Unfortunately the damage had already been done I was back to being that girl who couldn&#8217;t get out of the mirror who was putting herself down constantly not leaving the house constantly skipping school because she didn&#8217;t want people to see her &#8220;look&#8221; this way",
  " So again we switched me medication",
  "I started to feel a little better",
  " I still didn&#8217;t feel great about myself but I managed to just push through it",
  " I was still getting horrible grades By the time I was in grade 12 i was 12 credits behind",
  " It would take me forever to get through high school so the school councillor decided it would benefit me to go a college where they have a program where people can finish high school with being so far behind in credits",
  " I thought this is perfect I finally get out of this school where people have been so mean to me",
  " Maybe this school would be a better fit",
  " And it was",
  " Everyone there excepted me because we were all going through the same problems with school",
  " I ended up getting all 12 credits in one year of being there",
  " I was determined to get through high school and not be a drop out",
  " With average grades I may add",
  "After I had finished school I ended up getting a job had a new boyfriend, had a confidence that I had never had before",
  " I felt great",
  " I was able to go out with friends and have a good time",
  " But all good things come to an end",
  " After 3 years I quit that job because of management my boyfriend had broken up with me , which I did not see coming",
  " I spiraled back into the girl that I used to be",
  " I thought I had beat my disorder",
  " Little did I know, you never really beat it, you just learn to cope with it",
  " To this day I still struggle with my BDD every day",
  " Constantly asking for reassurance of if I\u2019m pretty or if I\u2019m fat",
  " I still ask myself why did this have to happen to me",
  " I\u2019m now 26, I\u2019m not married, I have no children, what if I give my disorder to my child",
  " I would feel too guilty for that",
  " But I still push through instead of giving up",
  " I will struggle with this for the rest of my life but knowing I have my family and many people who support me it makes it a little bit better easier",

  "  These young women are exactly what they are supposed to be\u2026they are smart, sweet, sassy, tough, resilient and determined",

  "  We have been running this same block for two and a half months",
  "  There have been some interesting observations during that time, but the one that is troubling me the most is about a set of clothes that lies in our running path, outside of the fenced in area",
  "The clothes first appeared two weeks ago",
  "  It was a beautiful sunny day and we were running when we came upon what looked like the contents of a gym bag emptied out",
  "  The clothes looked like they were in good condition",
  "   My assumption was that a bag had broken or kids were fooling around and the clothes were left behind",
  "  Surely, someone would come back for them",

  "  They were soaked but they all remained there on the sidewalk",
  "  And we ran past them",
  "  Did I stop to pick them up",
  " No",
  "  Was it because they were wet",
  "  I can say that I didn\u2019t have a garbage bag with me, but is that the whole reason",
  "Let\u2019s move to Tuesday",
  "  We are running and we pass the spot of the clothes",
  "  Some are now gone, but one or two soaked articles remain",
  "  Do you know what else I notice",
  "  There is a decent amount of garbage that is now present on the outside of the fence",
  "  Fast food cups and plastic bags",
  "  The whole area outside of the fence looks horrible",
  "  And we run past",
  "  Do I stop to pick it up",
  "  I didn\u2019t have a garbage bag",
  "  Is that my excuse",
  "So the issue I am having with the Bake Sale tomorrow is\u2026why didn\u2019t the girls choose to clean up the school grounds first",
  "  Isn\u2019t that a better use of our time",

  "  I don\u2019t think they \u201csee\u201d the clothes",

  "Dedication: To everyone that has been to scared to speak up or get helpLet\u2019s move fastMy last memory of being young dates back to the early 90\u2019s",
  " Possibly because my life before age five was so fast paced and moved so much that my mind has chosen to forget the things I feel would hurt me now if I knew them",
  " They are still lingering there, like the Cobb web you run into",
  " Eventually you get it all off but you avoid it at all cost if you ever run into it ever again",
  " Of course I would mention how much worse it could be but if I can\u2019t remember then maybe it is something that really wasn\u2019t that bad",
  " Let\u2019s start out with who I am now and work our way back to my first memory",
  " Now at age twenty eight I am a mother, a divorced woman, a daughter, a sister, an aunt, I would say friend but I really don\u2019t have any friends, and of course every other label I am that comes with living in this modern world of 2019",
  " I work to live and live to survive",
  " Recently I joined that lovely band wagon of millions that take antidepressants",
  " Mine certainly is for my anxiety",
  " I want things perfect but then again I don\u2019t",
  " I am caught in between so I now medicate to function properly as I should",
  " I can adapt quickly, think on my feet, and change my mind so fast that I could convince a priest to become a pornstar",
  " All in all I am a good person",
  " I mean well and I want to help people",
  " Growing up that\u2019s all I wanted to do",
  " I didn\u2019t even know how the hell I was for that matter but I will be damned if I couldn\u2019t put on a show to show my confidence to those I would try to fool or convince that is how they should hold themselves up to be",
  " I did it well",
  " I knew how to be an actress from age five to now, that\u2019s most likely why they say women are the devil",
  " My first memory I remember is being age five and walking in the one bedroom home smelling the carpet and scent of food that was cooked earlier",
  " Then making my way to the only bedroom we had as a family of five",
  " Seeing my family member above a man and then it struck me, Curiosity",
  " Before ever seeing what my five year old eyes had seen, I didn\u2019t even think about what sex was",
  " I brought this grand new experience of seeing something new to my childhood best friend; which later I would regret",
  " My childhood best friend was amazed that I hadn\u2019t known about it before",
  " I, of course, wasn\u2019t going to be made a fool even at age five",
  " So she showed me what sex meant, she showed me what adults do, and then my curiosity turned in me being a personal lab rat of hers in a child form",
  " This went on for a couple of years till my family decided to move to the Midwest",
  " Again, coast to coast and now to the middle",
  " Best decision that could have been made",
  "The MidwestFast-forward to my new life in the Midwest",
  " New school, new people, new family members to meet, and a whole new life to adjust to but at least I was away from the girl that would play house too much with me",
  " Instead of moving in from that type of play I let other family members know of my not so new found obsession",
  " Then shit hit the fan",
  " Not to where I got physically hurt but in whatever saving grace it didn\u2019t get to that point",
  " I had a lot of alone time growing up and so I did what I knew made me feel better",
  " Giving myself physical attention",
  " It was like I was filling a void",
  " But I could never fill it",
  " This haunted me",
  " I wish I had someone in my life I could cry too about all my emotions and all the wrong guilt I had built inside of me for such a young age I wrecked myself with being a little adult in a kid body",
  " Things only got worse when I became a teenager",
  " Oh the hormones are never any fun",
  " All high and mighty and in my case I was young beautiful talented and willing",
  " This big move was a smart one, but my ghost were still playing treats on me as a kid",
  " I wished nothing more to go to my mother about this things but I was terrified of getting in trouble, getting others in trouble and all in all immense guilt that strangled me for years",
  " I prayed every night that God would somehow give me the courage to speak but every time I tried I would change the subject or act like everything was fine",
  " I was screaming inside, numb, and alone at age five and up",
  " This all caused my depression and anxiety that I have now",
  " I learned to deal with it well",
  " Sometimes it is too much to handle, but we will fast forward here shortly as I am accustom to moving quickly",
  "  My downfallMen, my downfall",
  " I let guys my age in high school take advantage of me and then ignore me when we were in public",
  " I was looked at as a toy or a piece of meat",
  " I allowed such a thing to happen",
  " My family didn\u2019t know, as far as I know they didn\u2019t know how badly I needed help and how badly I wanted to end my life because I kept giving my attention, body, mind and soul to this guys that just used me",
  " I did all this again to try and fill that void",
  " I reached a weak point shortly after high school",
  " Men, my downfall",
  " I wanted to sing, dance, act and change the world, but men happened and that was the end of me",
  " It began to spiral when I let older men into my life",
  " Imagine a seventeen year old sleeping with 20+ year old men and her thinking they love her and that\u2019s why they do those things to her and say such sweet things, but really it\u2019s just a young piece of girl they can use till they don\u2019t want her anymore and on to the next broken up girl",
  " I continued to have a spark in my heart to be good even though I was feeling like a piece of crumpled up art",
  " That is what saved me a lot of times from really bad people",
  " Having a being good inside saved me from ever hitting rock bottom because I never have one to go to",
  " I struggled with men, but when one man came into my life, it changed everything about how I thought about men",
  " My son, unplanned, unwanted at the time of pregnancy, and not ready for him",
  " As time went on growing him inside my body I felt the love, compassion, and motherly side of me growing as well",
  " He was the arrival of a new woman with faults she could not control",
  " But he would be there to understand his mother as she is and all she can be",
  " My downfalls were always still there from choosing drug addict boyfriends to getting knocked up again but this time on agreed terms",
  " This term brought me a beautiful little girl that I wished nothing more than to make sure she didn\u2019t grow up with my emotional roller coasters",
  " Again, my downfalls kept appearing",
  " I kept repeating history as if it would somehow change if I did things a certain way",
  " In all actually it was all leading me to my high school best friend",
  " One of my up falls, which hurt the most",
  " I spent the most time trying to love two people I could never really truly love",
  " With this up fall I cheated, I lied, I was used, I laid there numb, I dragged us all for years, I did this but because no one spoke up to take my spot light I acted",
  " I was so good at it",
  " A part of me felt like it was play house all over again searching for attention in all the wrong places",
  " This time I was hurting people, this time I was the downfall",
  " I had to run",
  " Run and latch onto something that was not any like that of my past",
  " I needed to apologize to those I felt needed to do the same",
  " Now three children later I find myself at my most powerful",
  " My most undefeated self I can be because they are my reason to go",
  " They and I left, We left behind a wounded man and wounded little girl that we would have never left behind if I didn\u2019t ever feel I could leave without knowing we would be okay one day as I learned growing up from my own coast to coast then in the middle",
  " It hurt\u2026 it still does",
  " It was time for change",
  " Not only did I pinky promise myself to be the best version of myself from now on but I felt free",
  " Free from chains that I latched myself onto",
  " Hurting inside but that will never go away",
  " From intention to rape at age nine, to being molested by a girl my age from five to six, to dating every guy I found would \u201clove\u201d me, to feeling like a disappointment to my family and not being able to open up to them about it",
  " I finally had enough",
  " My life of lies and make believe were over",

  " We fell short when it came to the emotional side of things and that is not something to blame on just one person",
  " It is to blame generations of society implementing a certain way how families should be and cultures turning the other cheek to avoid emotional tremolos",
  " It takes a special kind of person to not let your traditional up bringing to solidify how you will raise your kids",
  " It takes a broken inside but strong in the heart kind of person to stand against hiding in the shadows",

  " To stay silent because of this and that is torture",
  " You build your own prison in your mind and soon you end up joining the band wagon of millions on meds to function",
  " I had light growing up and I had darkness",
  " Things could have gone a certain way but then I wouldn\u2019t be such a badass now I would say",
  " Always having well in your heart gets you a long way even when it is punished",
  " I value my family even though it was just basic needs, I value where I been even though it was some rough patches at times",
  " Most of all I value all of those that hurt me because ay hey taught me to see well in others and be compassionate now at age twenty eight",
  " I can be the best 90\u2019s kid grown up",
  " I know in my heart of hearts that my family did the best they could and only did what they grew up to know",
  " For that I thank them for trying to help me be better than what was expected",
  "My plan because we always should have onePlans, if you plan them well, usually don\u2019t work out the way you meant them to be is what I learned",
  " Especially for someone like me that lives a life of being a good woman, mom, wife, and of course all the other labels that society has brought to my attention",
  " For my own agenda, I plan on advocating emotional connections in families so people don\u2019t grow up all fucked up for not being able to tell others what the hell they are feeling",
  " In another part of my plans is to still change the world somehow, don\u2019t know yet, but all great things take time, look at the Notre Dame for goodness sakes, place burned down after centuries but sure as hell it\u2019s going to be rebuilt by people coming together to help with the crappy situation",
  " My idea is to keep building myself up from here, well more like a year and a half ago me, I am still in good shape",
  " Not new condition but like new, I know I would totally buy myself on amazon if I were a deal",
  " Luckily I am not up for sale though",
  " I have my family and they are my plan",
  " Main plan to be exact because without them I can\u2019t make up from all the shitty times I had in my past life",
  " Only way to find out what will happen from here is to make your own plan, you know",
  " No one else really cares but yourself because it is your life",
  " Not their outcome so it\u2019s not their journey",
  " That is how life works",
  " We all die but not many get a chance to really live",

  "  While I wasn\u2019t sure that my daughter was cut out to run 3",
  "1 miles, I was willing to give this program a shot",
  "  So one January evening at 6 pm, the sign ups opened and I was on line",
  "  The slots fill up fast, I was told, and you wanted to make sure to sign up right away",
  "  The amount of the registration was something we could budget, but through this process I had a moment of\u2026what do other girls do",
  "  What do other girls do who don\u2019t have a parent who is able to be on line at 6 p",

  " to pay a nice fee for a program that they hope will work for their daughter",
  "  When I look back, I am not sure when I first started to be aware of my body image as a young girl",
  "  In a world where my greatest exposure was the JCPenney catalog and an occasional Seventeen magazine, I know it was much later in life than my daughter",
  "  When I look back, I am sure when I first realized that I, too, could run",
  "  It was at the age of 43 when I signed my daughter up for GOTR",
  "  The program has the option of signing up a friend or family member to run with your daughter or assigning her a running buddy",
  "  When she asked me to run with her, I said: \u201cI\u2019m not really a runner",
  "\u201d  She said: \u201cneither am I",
  "\u201d Touch\u00e9, I signed up to run with her",
  "From March to June, we became runners",
  "  She would come home after each practice and tell me how many laps she was able to do",
  "  The number of laps grew, but more importantly she grew",
  "  She would also come home and tell me about the lesson of the day",
  "  Girls On The Run incorporates lessons on self-esteem and self-confidence, while it encourages healthy eating choices and taking good care of your body",
  "  Soon, inspirational quotes started to appear on her door\u2026they were cut outs from the lessons they did at GOTR",
  "  About the same time, she started to explore healthier snacks and become more aware of the choices she was making",
  "  This program was making a positive impact",
  "And then it was race day",
  "  As we made our way down the hill to the race, music was pumping and flashes of pink caught my eye against the beautiful blue sky and the green grass",
  "  There were stands to get your hair sprayed and healthy snacks to consume",
  "  And there were happy teams of girls getting pictures taken together as they prepared to run",
  "The gun went off and hundreds of girls and their running buddies took off together",
  "  There were fans cheering and water breaks at key stations along the course",
  "  And the course, itself, was filled with running buddies encouraging their partners",
  "  You can do this, they were telling the girls",
  "  And they did",
  "  Every",
  " Last",
  " Girl",
  " Finished",
  "  How is that for incredibly amazing",
  "  These girls, many running their first 5K, all crossed the finish line",
  "  Sure, they did so at different paces, but the cheers were as strong for the first one who crossed as they are for the last one",
  "  As I watched one young woman use every last drop of energy to cross the line, supported by multiple running buddies, I became hooked",
  "  A program that could make this much of an impact on one girl multiplied by hundreds was one that I wanted to support in any way that I possibly could",
  "As for my daughter, she turns 11 this week",
  "  I wish I could tell you that every doubt that she had about her body disappeared after GOTR",
  "  It didn\u2019t, but neither did the impact of GOTR on her life",
  "  She still prefers the swimming pool to the running course, but the important thing is she knows SHE CAN RUN",
  "  Those lessons on self-esteem and self- confidence still seem to be with her",
  "  I can see her growing more confident every day, and I can see her learning to appreciate her body for the amazing abilities it has",
  "  I am incredibly thankful that we came across this program",
  "  I am even more thankful that we were able to afford her participation, because, unlike me, she is exposed to so much more than the JCPenney catalog and an occasional Seventeen Magazine",
  "  She and her peers are flooded with images hourly of what their bodies should look like and do",
  "  I want to support a program that helps to send the right messages and helps to build self-esteem",
  "  I have witnessed the impact Girls on the Run on \u201cmy girl\u201d and I am committed to providing the same opportunity for other girls in the Lehigh Valley",

  "And before you start thinking&#8230;here she goes again, I think I have read all I need to about GOTR through Jill\u2019s lens",

  "  And yes, I\u2019ve read that she became a runner because of this program",
  "  Yep, I know she coached this spring and that every one of the 20 girls in the program that started the program, finished it and finished the 5K",
  "  But today I want to tell you about GOTR and its impact on the universe through a story that I haven\u2019t shared with you",
  "  It is a story about my friend Kim",
  "  Kim was a fifth grader in the program that I coached",
  "  A beautiful girl, she giggled, walked with confidence and carried herself in a way that seemed a bit beyond her 11 years",
  "On one of the first days of practice, we were dismissing the girls and sorting out which of them were walkers and which of them needed a parent to pick them up",
  "  Kim had already been on our coaches collective radar screen, as she had challenged Coach Jen from day one",
  " Looking through the list, I stopped Kim and asked her to wait&#8230;I needed to see if she was allowed to walk home without an adult",
  "  When I asked her this, she turned on her heel and gave me one of those reactions that makes you want to never lay eyes on another tween girl again",
  "  I stopped her, put down the clipboard and told her that her reaction was uncalled for and she needed to keep in mind that I was just looking out for her safety",
  "  I asked her for an apology, which she mumbled and then promptly marched off to catch up with her friends",
  "I shared the story with Devon that night",
  "  Devon, also 11 years old, had very big eyes when I told her of the interaction",
  "  I think she was a little uncomfortable with her mom \u201ccalling Kim\u201d on her behavior",
  "  I also think she was surprised that Kim would act this way towards a coach",
  "  I told Devon that I needed to call Kim on her behavior, because Kim might not have a Mom or an adult around to do so",
  "  I also reminded Devon that she has the tendency to share some of those same looks with me from time to time, and I call her on it, too",
  "  I was doing the same thing for Kim that I would do for my own daughter",
  "  I missed the following day of practice for a work meeting",
  "  It would be the only practice that I missed all season, and while I didn\u2019t think the girls would notice, Kim did",
  "  When I came back the following week, she ran up to me and asked where I had been last week",
  " I told her I had a work meeting and I was sorry to miss practice",
  " She looked at me and said, \u201cI thought you weren\u2019t coming back",
  "\u201d  I smiled and told her she couldn\u2019t scare me off that easily",
  "From that point forward, Kim became one of my favorites",
  "  She fell during a practice and I was the one to take her to the nurse",
  "  The nurse examined her and placed her arm in a bandage",
  "  While we were sitting in the office, the nurse called the emergency numbers on Kim\u2019s list",
  "  No one answered at the first number",
  "  The next two numbers were disconnected",
  "  When the nurse asked who was at home, Kim said her grandmother",
  "  When the nurse asked if her grandmother spoke english, Kim said she did not",
  "  Kim went onto say that the only english speaker in the house and the only person to contact in case of emergency was her 14 year old sister",
  "  Kim\u2019s arm was fine, but this fire drill made me wonder what would happen if she needed an adult to care for her in the case of a real emergency",
  "Kim came to every practice",
  "  She participated but you could tell she enjoyed being in the middle of her pack of girls some days more than the running",
  "  She isn\u2019t one of the girls that I expected to cross the finish line in the first wave, so when she did, I smiled",
  "  Look at that, I thought, \u201cshe had it in her all along",
  "\u201dI wrote her a note at the end of the season to tell her how proud I was of her and the progress she had made",
  "  I included a picture of her strongly crossing the finish line",
  "  When I heard back from her, she said the note \u201cmelted her heart with the words I said about her",
  "\u201d  This program and the belief in this young woman had melted more than her heart, it had melted some of her tough exterior",
  "   She wasn\u2019t the fifth grader with a bit of attitude",
  "  She was a young woman who was more confident and willing to show her love and affection for her friends and for her coaches",
  "  Look at that, I thought, \u201cshe had it in her all along",
  "\u201dI wish I could flash forward and tell you that Kim lived happily ever after",
  "  I don\u2019t know that yet, but I do know that Girls on the Run enabled her to see that \u201cshe had it in her all along",
  "\u201d  She had the physical strength and stamina to be competitive in the 5k",
  "  More importantly, she had the emotional strength and stamina to let others in and melt away some of her tough exterior",
  "  You and I both know that Kim is living in a tough world because we live in it, too",
  "  But most of us are fortunate to live in a different zip code than Kim does and many of us have had Moms and mentors who have helped us discover that \u201cwe had it in us all along",

  "Dedication: GOTR LV Staff (Jess, Liz and Lisa) for all of their support of me and my coaching journey",
  "I posted a video last night of an overexuberant set of coaches cheering on a girl for finishing a practice 5K in our Girls on the Run program",
  "  I am sure that some of you shook your heads and thought&#8230;what&#8217;s the big deal",
  " It&#8217;s a running program",
  " I thought they learned how to run in it",
  " You would be correct",
  "  It is a running program that contains lessons on self esteem, self confidence, friendship and girl power",
  "  And in a typical Girls on the Run program the participants learn how to run a 5K",
  " I guess what I have to tell you is that this program at my school this year was anything but typical",
  "The young woman in the video was one of 20 girls who started the program",
  "  On her first day, she was handed a booklet that outlined the lessons we would cover in the season",
  "  She went home and read the book with her Mom and would come in for the next four sessions and tell me what we would be covering that day",
  "  When I asked her how she knew, she would smile and say that she read the book with her mom",
  " I loved the time her Mom was spending with her and I loved her excitement over the program",
  "  So when I arrived at the school three weeks into the program and found her on the playground, I asked her why she wasn",
  "t inside getting ready to start our session",
  " She told me she had talked back to her Mom and her Mom had pulled her from the program as punishment",
  "  I&#8217;ve learned a few things in my three seasons at this school and one of them is that when something happens with one of the girls, you reach out to the parent",
  "  The parents fill out forms with their email addresses and cell phone numbers on them at the beginning of the season; it is not unusual for the emails to bounce back or the cell phones not to work when you call them",
  "  But in this case, the text message went through and I asked her Mom to reconsider",
  " She shared with me her reasoning and I told her I respected her and understood, but I asked her to give us another chance with Kayla",
  "  I told her the program would be so good for her and she would become even better at respecting herself and others",
  " And the Mom listened, and Kayla returned",
  "I wish I could tell you that she was the only girl we had to save this year, but I can&#8217;t",
  "  I wish I could tell you that all the saves were successful but they were not",
  " We started with 20 and we had three girls pulled from the program; we added two along the way; and another three quit but then one returned and then quit again",
  "  Each day, when taking attendance, we would ask where a specific girl was and often the answer was she quit",
  " For some, this was the truth and for others, they would return, sometimes after missing multiple practices",
  " If you asked me how many girls are in our program, I would tell you that I believe that answer is 16, but as you can see, the number is hard to track down and fluctuates",
  "Attendance was just one of the battles that we fought this year",
  "  And in fighting to get these girls to the program and stick with it, our consistency in getting them to run distances became secondary",
  "  So as a coach, I&#8217;ve had some battles within myself",
  " I&#8217;ve had moments of&#8230;wait, we didn&#8217;t teach them how to run a full 5K",
  " What will our running buddies think at the 5K next week",
  "  What will our girls think when they see girls from other schools whiz past them",
  " Have we failed",
  "Yesterday, when I saw Kayla cross the finish line of our little run-down city block, I answered all of these questions for myself",
  "  While we only had 6 girls complete our practice 5K in the 65 minutes we gave them, we had all 16 girls complete much more",
  "While I would have liked to teach them how to pace themselves as they run, I believe we taught them how to pace themselves in life",
  "  It&#8217;s easy to start out a race when the gun goes off and be excited to run",
  " It&#8217;s easy to start out a season ready to go",
  " At those times, we sprint, but it&#8217;s impossible to maintain that pace",
  "  So we have to learn to manage our energy through an entire race or an entire season and not quit",
  " This we did",
  "While I would have liked for all of them to experience how mind freeing a good run can be, I believe we taught them how good it can feel to be out in nature, simply moving your body&#8230;away from a screen and talking to a friend",
  " In the process, I hope we taught all of them how amazing it can feel to finish a race or a season that you didn&#8217;t think you could",
  "  I hope we taught them to dig in when things get tough",
  " I hope our example taught them about the difference you can make when you show up every single session all season long through yucky weather and tough circumstances",
  " So did we fail",
  " No way",
  "  We may not have taught all 16 girls how to run",
  "  But we taught our girls something much more valuable&#8230;we taught them to not quit",

  "Dedication: My late auntI had an aunt with inner talent but never showed it",
  " She actually baked cakes for a living and they were so delicious",
  " Other than that she also cooked for us",
  " She got married and soon had had children",
  " Her first born child was named victory and her second was Shalome",
  " I would play with them a lot",
  " One day at church, my aunt came walking past me but for some reason I didn\u2019t greet her",
  " She told my mom and my mom said to me \u201c that\u2019s my sister you know, when I die she will be taking care of you",
  "\u201d After she told me this, I thought to myself \u201cwhat if she dies first",
  "\u201d Another day came when I fainted in the middle of the road",
  " My aunt found me and and took me to the hospital",
  " I was feeling dizzy for some time but later on I was feeling well",
  " I realized that if my aunt wasn\u2019t there I could have *died*",
  " One day in September she decided to go to a teachers college",
  " She also received a note asking her to bake a cake for a wedding",
  " I had gone to my grandparents house where she sent me a happy message asking me how my grandparents were",
  " I replied with a smiley face",
  " A day later my grandmother told me that my aunt had died",
  " At first I didn\u2019t believe it but my mom phoned hardly talking but crying instead that is when I also started to cry",
  " We went to her funeral and when I saw her dead body I cried",
  "Remember that your aunt is like your mother",
  " Treat her like a mother",
  "Dedication: I like to dedicate this to anyone that has felt that betrayal",
  "Something that we don\u2019t see coming",
  " Maybe we did and maybe we didn\u2019t but it happens regardless",
  " You can be the best person you could be and tried your best but someone close to your heart can turn on",
  " We never thought someone that we hold so dear to our heart, would actually do something like that",
  " There\u2019s a saying \u201cDevil in Disguise\u201d it can appear as anything in our lives",
  " For example, a friend, a lover or a family member",
  " That\u2019s what makes it so difficult to trust but we must keep our head above water",
  " It\u2019s not as easy as it sounds but the \u2018impossible is possible\u2019",
  " That means to keep on moving no matter how hard it is",
  " Each pain makes you more strong, each betrayal, more intelligent, every disappointment more skillful and each experience more wise",
  " Everyone suffers at least one bad betrayal in their lifetime",
  " It\u2019s what unites us",
  " The trick is not is to let it destroy our trust in others when it happens",
  " Don\u2019t let them take that from you",
  " Don\u2019t let them take power over you",

  "Dedication: I dedicate this story to Bella, I hope shes still out there somewhereBella was the most beautiful and strongest girl I ever had the privilege of meeting",
  " She was Albanian, and though she didn&#8217;t speak English well at all, the two of us had an instant connection, and a lasting understanding of each other",
  " Her story broke me, and the pain she must have felt I couldn\u2019t even begin to imagine",
  "She was young, only 19, and had been raised by her grandmother her whole life, probably happily, until her grandmother passed and Bella was lost",
  " She had connected with who she thought was a smart young girl from Canada and had left her home country, flown to Canada, and met with the girl she had been communicating with online for months",
  " But it wasn&#8217;t a girl, when she arrived she was met with a man in his 20\u2019s, but it was too late for her",
  " From the second she had stepped on that plane it was too late for her",
  "At the time I was also being controlled by a pimp, one named Royall, who after months of controlling me, was starting to gain some trust in me",
  " He let me manage the other girls and as long as I still made my quota, he always made sure I was fed and had a roof over my head",
  " I was almost delusional, thinking Royall actually cared about me, but my story with Royall is for another time",
  "I didn\u2019t meet Bella until a few weeks after she had landed, when the man had brought her to us, and pulled Royall aside to explain",
  " She was a mess, she was bawling, and I knew I had to comfort her",
  " That was always my job, comfort the new ones, but there was something different about this one",
  "Royall later explained it to me, she had been brought over, and she had made no money, and the man, whose name was Lax, was giving her over saying she was a useless liability",
  " I didn\u2019t know if she understood what we were saying, but I knew I had to help her",
  " First, I had to figure her out",
  " We were sent to the other room to take pictures, set up an ad, and I was to teach her how to be \u201cuseful\u201d to our group",
  " But I used that time differently",
  " I used it to talk to her, and I used it to let her know she was safe\u2026",
  " Or as safe as she could be at that moment",
  "She didn\u2019t know the language well, but translator apps helped me get the message across, and also helped her get a message across to me",
  " A message that truly broke my heart",
  " Bella knew what was expected of her, but she wasn\u2019t like other girls Lax had scammed",
  " Bella was a lesbian, and I knew in that moment how to help her the best I could",
  " I told her that",
  " I told her with as much sincerity as I could manage, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything, just trust me, and I will keep you safe\u201d and she kissed me",
  " A long passionate kiss, and I knew she understood",
  "There was no need for a seperate ad for her, all we needed was the pictures, and I would take care of the rest to protect her",
  " She couldn\u2019t see clients alone, and I would make sure she wouldn\u2019t have to",
  " I added her pictures to my ad and posted as a duo, explaining to Royall that I was just \u201cteaching her what to do\u201d the truth being that I was making sure she wouldn\u2019t have to sleep with a man",
  "In that first night, in only one client, the two of us as a duo made over $2600 in entirely $100 bills",
  " Royall was happy, she was happy, and I felt like maybe for just a second I had done a little good towards the girl, I felt like I had helped her feel more comfortable in this new country",
  " I knew if we continued I\u2019d soon be able to get her a ticket and send her home",
  "But it wasn\u2019t meant to be",
  " I wasn\u2019t meant to save her",
  " We only got a week together and that week was the most wonderful whirlwind of love between the two of us",
  " Until Lax returned, having heard of Bellas sudden success",
  " I knew the second I saw him I would never see Bella again",
  "Bella came to me then, a smile on her face, but her words were not happy",
  "\u201cHe has things that belonged to my grandmother back in Albania, he says I can have them back I just need to earn them&#8230;\u201d I stopped her there,\u201cI won\u2019t be going with you Bella\u201d thinking that would make her reconsider but she shook her head, kissed me quick, and said,\u201cI know what to do now, I\u2019ll be back in a week, and we won\u2019t have to worry\u201dI knew those words were a lie Lax had fed her, I knew she wouldn\u2019t be back, I knew that if she walked out of our room with that man I would never see her again",
  " But when I tried to tell her, she simply shook her head, telling me not to worry, and repeating that she would be back in a week",
  "I kissed her one last time, and never saw her again",

  "July 17, 2002 a boy by the name of Jake was born",
  " Little did he or his parents know but he was born with a different mind from the rest",
  " He was born with addiction disorder",
  " All he wanted was to feel accepted, loved, and to never feel alone",
  " Jake didn\u2019t know why but he could never feel those things, no matter what others told him",
  " He was a very sad and lonely boy thinking he was trapped and that there was nothing he could do to change it",
  " By the time he was 13 he had found drugs and alcohol",
  " This caused his whole world to change because when he was high, he could finally feel those things he had always wanted",
  " He quickly began to overuse them and by the time he was 14 he had ran away leaving him homeless for a couple of months",
  " All of his interactions, whether it be with friends or adults, had been to get something out of someone",
  " He became extremely sad, lonely, depressed, and filled with anxiety",
  " All he could do day after day was focus on when he was going to get high next or when he could steal money from someone",
  " He became very suicidal because this was a very lonely and sad way of life",
  " Leading him to believe no one cared about him and he had nowhere to turn",
  "His parents became very sad, missing their little boy that they loved so much and often left him calls or texts asking him to come home",
  " They were terrified of what he was doing, where he was, and who he was hanging out with",
  " He didn\u2019t care, all he cared about was himself and how he felt",
  " This took him down dark paths of only thinking about himself and what others thought of him",
  " Drugs started destroying Jakes mind and body leading him to become a horrible human being",
  " He felt like he was walking with the dead",
  "Eventually Jake came home to his parents who were overjoyed to see him, but his parents didn\u2019t know Jake had only come home for one reason",

  " He also stole $1,800 from his brothers",
  " Jake didn\u2019t give a single thought about anyone other than himself",
  " Jake\u2019s mom was terrified of what she had raised",
  " She was so sad to see her son in this condition of only caring about himself and constantly filling his body with drugs",
  " She would try to save him by taking away his phone or grounding him",
  " Jake had a second phone so he could always be in contact with his friends and drug dealers and would hangout with his friends regardless of what his mother said",
  " She cried almost every time she saw him because she didn\u2019t know how to help him",
  " There was nothing she could do to help him",
  " Jake had began yelling very hateful things toward his parents and it only made them more sad",
  " Jake didn\u2019t realize all his parents did was care about them",
  " He was under all of these crazy delusions that his parents hated him and wanted him gone",
  " He thought the world was out to get him and that it was a very dark and evil place",
  " He and his parents never got along and one night he got in another huge fight with his parents",
  " He ran away again and he was alone",
  " Once again",
  " He then started taking harder and harder drugs but this was only hurting the situation",
  " He felt so empty and so alone and cried often thinking he couldn\u2019t go anywhere with his life and he felt trapped",
  " He finally came home and his parents sent him to a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center",
  " Jake continued to use drugs and nothing changed he was still so sad and lonely and yelled at his parents every chance he could",
  " He hated that he couldn\u2019t be normal and just wanted to fit in with the kids at his school",
  " Jake\u2019s new friends at his rehab showed him what true love was but Jake didn\u2019t accept it, he denied it and still felt alone",
  " Jake\u2019s counselors decided he needed more help because if he kept living in Kansas City he was going to die",
  " He got sent down to Phoenix, Arizona and he was very angry about this",
  " Jake didn\u2019t want anything to do with the people there and treated all of them terribly",
  " They continued to put up with Jake no matter what he would tell them",
  " Jake struggled for a couple of weeks and was unwilling to take their direction",
  " He was miserable because he felt like he was stuck with a bunch of losers",
  " Jake didn\u2019t want to give up his way of life",
  " Finally, one day Jake got broken down and he cracked",
  " He cried and finally talked about how sad he is, how much he hates himself and how he was terrified of the future",
  " That was the day everything changed and Jake was willing to try what they were telling him about",
  " He put in effort to be there with others and finally make real friendships",
  " He then learned how to finally accept love",
  " He learned how to love himself and how to love others",
  " Jake experienced a psychic change and everything he thought to be true changed",
  " The way he thought changed and the way he viewed things changed",

  " He grew great relationships with his parents and friends",
  "I am Jake and this is a true story about me",
  " I\u2019ve never been as happy as I am right now with my life",
  " I now have a year and almost 4 months sober",
  " Now I spend a lot of my time helping other people who were just like me",
  " It\u2019s the most fulfilling thing I\u2019ve ever done",
  " I now know how to treat my addiction and couldn\u2019t be more grateful",
  " I\u2019m also extremely grateful for my parents sending me to rehab because without them I wouldn\u2019t be alive today",

  " You are now panicking trying to think of what you could use to stop the bleeding and the only thing you could think of was your old WHITE school socks, Your Father&#8217;s Newspaper edition from the previous day or an old cloth that belonged to your mother, luckily she would not notice it went missing",

  " Reality kicks in as you are forced to choose between your dignity or the pending test, there is no way out for you but to choose dignity(the little that is left of it over school) because the period shaming would be too much for you to handle",
  " Your community does not want to see your blood stains yet they do not want to hear your plea for menstrual support",
  " Your teachers expect you to have the very best grades yet they never bother to ask why you constantly miss school every four days of the month",
  " If only people could change their views about Menstruation and give our girls the opportunity to ask when in need and not humiliate them each time they bleed, that way we will break the Taboos about PERIODS and make girls understand that their Pride lies in their ability to speak freely about their menstrual concerns and get the support they need",

  "On my very first day at a private middle school, I was convinced that all 23 of the sixth graders attending there would be dignified, independant, and behaved",
  " They were not",
  " At my old elementary school, I had a reputation for being a fun-loving, always joking around kind of person",
  " I was really nervous that I would have to ditch that personality at this new school and become a model student",

  " Sure, they were a bit smarter, but they were certainly not the teacher&#8217;s pets I&#8217;d expected them to be",
  " For my first month at school, I dedicated my time to making a couple new friends and finding my way around the school, which was hard because many of the kids had been attending this school since they were toddlers, and they were all super close",
  " But, I soon got really comfortable with being around all the kids, and by December, I was completly back to my old, fun-loving self",
  " The other kids had gotten pretty used to me, too, and started teasing me a little",
  " Everyone at this school took immense pleasure in teasing and roasting each other, just like in elementary school",
  " I was the perfect target for some of the best roasts- I was wierd, but smart, and I was not only the tallest girl in our grade, but the tallest person in our grade",
  " Everyone who knew me well knew that I never got involved in drama",
  " People often came to me for advice, but whenever someone insulted me, I always laughed and said something clever back",
  " I never let it get to me",
  " So, once the kids at school saw that I would not be bothered by their teasing, they took it to the next level, and started treating me as if I were one of them",
  " It never really bothered me",
  " But, by January, they had actually started to insult me on a very personal level",
  " I felt like I could not ever show them that I was actually started to feel incredibly hurt by their comments, because I was always that one kid who never got involved in the drama",
  " And, they couldn&#8217;t take me seriously",
  " In elementary school, I was on the Science Olympiad team, and won first place in anatomy in the regionals",
  " That was a huge deal for our team",

  " When they started making racist and politicial comments about me, I seriously told them that it was not OK, but they just laughed, not taking me seriously",
  " I was so ashamed of myself when I laughed at their racist comments",
  " The worst part was, no one would ever truly listen to how I felt, and my parents were constantly attending to my 2 younger siblings",
  " My sorrow, grief, guilt, and anger was all bottled up inside me",

  " I fractured my shoulder blade, collar bone, sternum, 2 ribs, knee, and my foot",
  " Also the skin on part of my arm was completely shredded up",
  " After a week of my doctors fighting about what needs surgery first, my neurologist decided everything had to wait",
  " They took me off life support, and she thought my brain needed time to heal before I could live through anyone trying to fix my broken body",
  " They had told my family IF I survived that I WOULD be paralyzed from the neck down",
  " 2 more weeks passed without surgery, and continued improvements",
  " First a slight movement of my hand, then a slight squeeze",
  " Everyday I would move a little more than the day before",
  " The day I was switching from the hospital to the rehab hospital I &#8220;walked&#8221; with two therapist basically walking for me, It wasn&#8217;t easy but I did it",

  " He&#8217;d ask if I knew my name, the date, and where I was which I got better at answering as time went on",
  " I remember a week or two after being at the rehab hospital trying to walk with my therapist, literally thinking to myself left foot then right foot",
  " My feet wouldn&#8217;t work no matter how hard I tried",
  " I went back to my room, looked out the window and cried for hours",
  " After being hoyer lifted back in to bed that night I prayed",
  " I said, &#8220;Lord can I please just die tonight in my sleep this isn&#8217;t fair",

  " You can either feel sorry for yourself and suffer, or you can fight and see what happens",
  "&#8221; Thankfully god gave me the strength and courage to fight and never look back",
  " I was in the rehab hospital a total of 7 weeks",
  " In that time I retaught my body how to function and support itself enough to sit, walk, get dressed, go to the bathroom, shower with a chair, brush my teeth and feed myself",
  " I retaught my brain to talk, remember, and process things",
  " As time went on, out patient therapy 3 times a week for 4 month helped me learn to jog, drive, put my hair up myself, and other major things any 18 year old would want to do",
  " Mid 2016 as I overcame a lot of physical obstacles I then began facing my hardest obstacle yet, PTSD",
  " Trying to understand what happened to me and what I had been through with a Traumatic brain injury was near impossible",

  " After months of dealing with my own thoughts and emotions, I remembered that dealing with all the horrible physical pain I went through was easier than my own demons, I began cutting my arms",
  " I never cut to kill myself, just to distract myself from my emotional pain by causing physical pain",

  "  With deepest gratitude I dedicate this post to her and thank her for her many, many lessons about love and about empowerment",
  "I once thought that it was major life decisions that determined whether we are empowered or not \u2013 deciding to stand up for ourselves when our voice is not being heard, or to leave an abusive or otherwise unhealthy relationship, or to pursue our dreams despite the objections of others who believe they know what is best for us",
  "I realize now that my personal journey to empowerment has been an ongoing series of opportunities and decisions made over the course of my life &#8211; some big decisions, but also many choices that seemed minor and insignificant at the time I made them",
  " Recent life events have caused me to reflect again on empowerment and on the role that love has played (and continues to play) in the decisions that shape my life",
  " Love for others, and a willingness to please them, sometimes led me to make disempowering choices",
  " It pains me to admit this, but it is true",
  " For me, the road to empowerment has been a series of steps and missteps that have either advanced my sense of empowerment or temporarily stalled it",
  " The most frequent missteps were decisions I made to make others happy instead of making the decision that I actually thought was best",
  " I learned some difficult lessons from those decisions, and still do",
  "I have often heard that we cannot love and care for others if we do not love and care for ourselves first, and I dismissed this advice because it seemed directed to those who did not love or care for themselves at all",
  " That did not describe me",
  " I do love myself",
  " I do care for myself",
  " But the finer point of this advice is to explore the decisions I make when I am loving and caring for others much, much more than I am loving and caring for myself",
  "Self-love, self-care, self-compassion, and self-forgiveness have emerged as important themes in my recent thinking about empowerment",
  " And as a true believer in the power of our stories in shaping our lives, I am now committed to re-examining the stories that I tell myself when I am not treating self-care as a priority",
  "This week, many of us will celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day in some way",

  " However, most of them all had one thing in common (besides the bright smiles painted across their faces every week at practice) &#8211; they all needed a proper pair of running shoes",

  " Sorry for their parents who might not be able to afford a brand-new pair",
  " Sorry for the comments they might have to hear after a classmate makes fun of the holes in their shoes",
  " And a little sorry for myself too, for one very important reason you will find out soon",
  " A wonderful thing about our Girls on the Run chapter (and I\u2019m sure many others out there) is that they partner with a local running business to provide proper running shoes to girls who may need them",
  " One day, before practice, we had a \u201ctry on\u201d day where we helped the girls pick out their very own pair",
  " As a coach, this time is a little hectic because the girls get so excited about finding just the right fit",
  " Amid all of the commotion, one of my girls looked up at me with wide eyes and said, \u201cCoach Jordan, we\u2019ve never had Nikes before",
  "\u201d Wow",
  " I had to look away for a minute as I blinked the tears away from my eyes",
  " Some of these girls were in fifth grade and had never owned a nice pair of shoes that fit them well",
  " Right then, I couldn\u2019t help but think of little fifth grade Jordan, and the new pair of Nike Shocks my parents bought me at the beginning of each school year",
  " How I wish I could go back and share those shoes with these girls",
  " As a coach, Girls on the Run has a funny way of teaching you more than I ever could have imagined",
  " Each day is a new learning experience, and a new chance to apply the day\u2019s lesson to your own adult life",

  "We live our lifes from moment to moment, from breath to breath",
  "Somethings we hold our breath to make the moment last but at times we hold it, close our eyes and beg for the moment to pass",
  "It is like being under water where time stands still and sounds goes away but when you emerge to the surface the intensity of life comes right back",
  " There are the temporarily escapes by numbing of feelings but on the other side the world demands your presents but every moment becomes an opportunity for a fresh start",
  "For whatever reason we live similar lifes",
  " We are born, we grow and in the end we die",
  "What sets us apart is not our wealth or our families, nor is it the degrees or friends we have",
  " How we decide to live the life, with what we have been given and what we do when life hurts us, is what defines us",
  " Every moment we get the choice to choose our thoughts, our reactions and what we do next",
  " For us being here is really a miracle, so do we hold our breath or do we decide to breath fully, even when life is challenging us",
  "In the moments of the ugly uncomfortable truth we rarely look glamorous or in control",
  " It is often a spinning feeling were we feel like trowing up, beg for mercy and look for the strength to hold on",
  " With tears running down our cheeks painting our faces like a war zone",
  " On our hands and knees, we try to crawl out in the light where we hope to again find our way back to comfort and certainty",
  "Having hope and knowing that this moment to shall pass is what have made me survive in the storms of my life",
  " I have had times where I would numb myself or refuse to take the actions needed for me to live a life in my own greatness",
  " Here is a story of a few moments that helped defined me",
  "&#8211;I grew up in a family that from the outside must have looked pretty perfect but behind the walls another movie unfolded",
  " My parents love each other and me very much",
  " That is one thing they always let me know even-though at times I would have my doubts looking at their actions",
  " They were both beautiful people but had their own issues",
  " These issues were dealt with through large alcohol consumption, smoking cigarets and other entertainment methods, leaving little or no room for the attention of a child",
  " My parents got divorced when I was 5 years old and I moved with my mum which would shape my life and self beliefs in a way, I could never have imagined",
  "I always knew my family wasn&#8217;t like other families and when I was about 7 or 8 I found out why",
  " My mum would fall asleep on the couch every night with no way of me waking her and she would talk so strangely sometimes or there would be weeks were she couldn&#8217;t get out of bed at all",
  " My mum was an alcoholic and I quickly learnt that staying out of her way was a smart choice",
  "The problem with these choices we make as children, is we believe they will serve us through life",
  " I now know that its not the case",
  " A belief I made and was successful when I was 6 years old, has not been serving me well the last 20 years or more",
  "Eventually when I was around 12 years old I realised that I would never be free to live my own life unless I left my mums place",
  " I loved my mum dearly but taking care of her had become my after school activity while being in school was my free time",
  " Therefore my dad and I agreed for me to move in with him and his new family who I loved",
  " It was like being part of a real &#8220;normal&#8221; family, something I felt I had never tried before",
  " We lived together for about 3 years which was some of the best years of my life",
  " In the mean time my mum had gone to rehab and was sober, life was finally feeling right",
  "Then things started to fall apart",
  " First my dad and his wife divorced and she moved out so it was just my dad and I",
  " He was super depressed and I became the one he unloaded on",
  " Then later that year, being 15 years old, we received some more bad news",
  " It was a Sunday night and we had been out all day when the doorbell rang",
  " When I opened the door I saw that it was two policemen standing outside",
  " Dad told me to go to my room and as I had gotten very good at being easy and invisible I followed his order",
  " About 10 min later dad came to my room with tears in his eyes",
  " At this point I started to get worried",
  " He cried and hugged me",
  " I didn&#8217;t understand",
  " He looked at me and between the tears he sad &#8220;Darling your mum is dead&#8221;",
  " What",
  " When",
  " How",
  " Why",
  " NO",
  " I dont believe it",
  " It cant be true",
  " I was in total shock",
  " Your parents are not suppose to die &#8211; ever",
  " It all became a bit of a blur after that but at the same time an inside willpower started bubbling",
  " I knew this was a start of a era and my life would never be the same again",
  " I now was known as the girl with the dead mother",
  " Over night people didn&#8217;t know how to talk to me and some kept their distance",
  "All my life I had fought to be normal or like everybody else, making sure I flew under the radar and stayed out of trouble",
  " No matter what I seemed to do life had other plans with me",
  " It wanted me to be different and different I felt for sure",
  "Now why am I telling you this story",
  " Cause this was one of my many defining moments",
  " A moment I have relived over and over again",
  " It taught me that life is fragile and you better be grateful for what you got",
  " It also gave me the strength to understand my own power and how to see an oppotunity in every moment",
  " I found that I no longer had the chains of my mums alcoholism around my wrists so in some way I got my freedom",
  " I had never shared with anyone what I had experienced at my mums in the 10 years I lived with her but now that she was not here anymore I realised I didn&#8217;t have to protect her so I started sharing my story",
  " Finally sharing the experiences I had carried all on my own and letting go of the shame was elaborating as taking a breath of fresh air &#8211; I no longer had to carry any more secret",
  " I make a promise to myself and that was never to keep a secret like that every again",
  "I decided shortly after my mum passed that I needed to come clean with my school class about what had happened as I had lied to them about so many things as I couldn&#8217;t tell the truth",
  " less than 4 weeks after my mum died I stood up front of my class and teachers sharing my story",
  " I has an outsider, remember I liked to fly under the radar so no one had expected this from me",
  " I spoke for two hours sharing with my classmates what alcoholism really is like and how it is growing up in a home where that wins over love",
  " I had been part of this class for close to 10 years and people were shocked and sad but most of all deeply moved by my honesty and rawness",
  " The connection we made that day and the memory of us walking as one out of school that day, guess my classmates way to express what they felt, has never left me",
  " It is what has driven me to keep sharing my story and every time I share it I feel a deep connection",
  " Maybe I was meant to be different or to have a challenging life so I could tell my story to empower others to share theres",
  " One thing I know is that life will keep pushing you to step into your real power until the day you give in or the pain avoiding it become to big",
  " It took me a long time to understand you can escape your past or your destiny but you can embarrass it and make it your fuel",
  "I hope this story can inspire you to look at the moments that have defined you and open up to the possibility of how you can impact this world with all the wonderful talents you already have",

  " The day my husband&#8217;s paycheck went into the bank account I instantly paid the shut off for the electric, scheduled out all the other bills that needed to be paid, subtracted money for gas and groceries, then when to the store to pick up the layaway",
  " The store was crazy in the area of the layaway and as I waited there I kept looking at the trees wishing that we could get one for the boys and a few things for their stockings to make Christmas just a little bit more magical for them my youngest is only 2-years-old so he is surprised with everything",
  " When my turn finally comes and I hand the lady my receipt and she scans it and tells me my total is under $20",
  " I know this is not the total given that I am the only one that knew about the layaway so I ask her if she is correct",
  " She then looks at the monitor and says, &#8220;That&#8217;s what it says so that&#8217;s all you pay",
  "&#8221; I have no idea how my layaway was cheaper they gave no explanation all I can think is I heard of people paying on random layaways when I was younger maybe that is what happened",
  " I wanted to cry it was a Christmas miracle to my family we were able to get a few small stocking stuffers and a tree for the boys to enjoy",
  " Next year I hope that our situation is better than so I can pay it forward by helping a family in need",

  "Dedication: To my son CaydenMy name is De&#8217;Ana Forbes",
  " I am a student at James Madison University (JMU) in Harrisonburg, VA",
  " I enrolled at the university in the fall of 2013 after being recruited to run hurdles for the women&#8217;s track and field team",
  " The transition from high school to division 1 collegiate athletics was extremely challenging",
  " The act of keeping up with rigorous coursework and the demands of athletics left me almost wanting to quit",
  " But I did not, and before I knew it I was breaking school records in the 60 meter hurdles and claiming conference championship titles in the 100 meter hurdles and 4&#215;100 meter relay with my teammates",
  " I was a leader for my team, perhaps one of the strongest role models and many of the women on the team young and old looked up to me",
  " Then, two weeks before the start of my junior year I found out I was pregnant",
  "The number one question those around me asked was &#8220;so are you going to finish school",
  "&#8221; or &#8220;so how is that gonna work with school and track&#8221;",
  " I thought to myself &#8220;hmm I&#8217;m not sure why everyone thinks this is impossible for me&#8230;",
  "but more importantly&#8230;my God",
  "&#8221; Never once did I think this was a challenge I wasn&#8217;t going to be able to complete",
  " So, I went through my entire junior year pregnant, practicing with my team, running, lifting and making the best grades I ever made in school",
  " I can\u2019t say that I embraced my pregnancy, because I didn&#8217;t",
  " I was ashamed to post many pictures or talk about my excitement of having a child",
  " I wasn&#8217;t married, finish with school nor did I have a job or car",
  " All I knew was that I was going to have this baby during finals week and that I was going to graduate in May 2017-which I did by the grace of God",
  "May 2017, I got my B",
  "A in History with minors in secondary education and interdisciplinary social sciences",
  " I did not get to physically walk with my classmates because of athletic duties on the day of graduation, but I was still proud of myself for defying every odd against me",
  " Right now, I am in my second year of working on my Masters of Art in Teaching at James Madison University, I work 2 part time jobs, serve as a student coach for the JMU women&#8217;s track team and take care of my son as a single mother&#8211;an African American mother at that",
  " Even though my son and I experience some financial struggles, I do believe in tithing to my church and making charitable donations, even if it means giving out of my need",
  " To me, it\u2019s more so about the posture of my heart, which I know God sees",
  "It has been my dream to share my story more in depth and to encourage people of all walks of life to trust that there is light at the end of the tunnel, even when you feel you are surrounded by darkness",
  " We really are capable of doing anything we put our minds to, especially if we keep God first&#8211;because we are more than conquerors through Jesus Christ",
  " I would love to share my story in hopes of encouraging and empowering others to put their hope and trust in the lord during hard times",
  " I really don\u2019t know where I would be if it wasn\u2019t for God\u2019s word and his promises to never leave us nor forsake us",
  "As of today, I feel as though I take one day at a time",
  " Sometimes I get overwhelmed thinking about the future, where I\u2019m going to move, what school I will get hired at, when will God send me a husband, or even if I\u2019m a good enough mother",
  " A lot of times, I have to remove myself from social media because I find myself comparing myself to others or wondering why I don\u2019t have a husband yet",
  " At one point, I would go to bed crying to God that I\u2019m tired of carrying my son, groceries and my heavy book bag in the house alone everyday&#8211;a bit dramatic I know, but that was a real frustration for me",
  " Then I realized, I\u2019ve never been alone\u2026",
  "ever",
  " How must have God felt to hear me complain about being alone and lonely",
  " Everyday I have to pause, take deep breaths and know that God hasn\u2019t made any mistakes in my life and that he knows exactly what he\u2019s doing in my life",
  " I often think about his purpose for my life, which is something I am asking him to reveal to me through fasting, prayer and reading his word",
  " I know that I am imperfect, but I am made perfect in his love",
  " God has truly been awesome to me and I am so tired of keeping that to myself",
  " It\u2019s time to let the world know that I have been changed and to let those around me know the real reason I am able to endure such challenging times&#8211; the grace of God",

  "Dedication: My mother who suffered domestic violence in her marriage while trying to keep the family together",
  " She was a strong and amazing woman",
  "When I was a little girl, I thought I was worthless and would never amount to anything because of what I was told and the way I was treated",
  " I had dreams but as each day went by I thought I was never going to realise my dreams, it was such a scary thought",
  " As I grew older I begun to see just how damaged I was and how my past had halted my ability to think that I was capable of achieving anything",
  " Having being sexually molested from the age of seven to fourteen by my two brothers, I was an angry young woman and there was little or nothing anyone could do for me, so I thought",
  " I was in a dark and ugly place of depression, hopelessness, self hate, low self-esteem and low self-confidence",
  " I didn&#8217;t think I would live beyond 30 years old because I always contemplated suicide and had attempted a few times but never succeeded",
  " I felt empty inside, I was moving around without purpose or the will to live",
  " After years of abuse by my family members and men I had dated, my moment of liberation came when I was introduced to a faith based Non-Profit organization, Our Lady&#8217;s Hospice based in Lusaka, Zambia",
  " They embraced me and gave me hope, for once I found a group of people who were interested in me as I was and did not ask anything from me in return for their kindness",
  " I was thrilled by the love they showed me",
  " Their love also helped me realise that I was stronger than I thought",
  " I was able do more than I thought I could",
  " I rose above the pain and horrible past and became a positive example to other people who had been through similar situations",
  " I vowed to break the cycle of abuse in my own life so I can help others who were still struggling with the effects",
  " All this happened because someone believed in me and my abilities to become the best I could be",
  " I realised just how amazing I was when I was able to stand up for myself and speak out against all forms of injustice",
  " My love for humanity and seeing others rise above their struggles became greater each day and I realised I could be unstoppable if I wanted and If stayed true to the cause",
  " In any journey, negative people are always there to pull others down but I have refused to listen to the negative voices around me",
  " I learnt to be bold and fearless",
  " After fourteen years of working for various non-profit organizations I decided to found Liberated Hearts Foundation whose focus is on advocating for the rights of women, girls and children",
  " An organization that believes women, girls and children deserve to be in safe and abuse free homes as well as communities",
  " They should not live in fear as this limits their potential and robs them of a productive life",
  " I am even more thrilled that I was accorded an opportunity by the US department of State to participate in the International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP)",
  " This experience has boosted my confidence as a leader of an organization",
  " I can&#8217;t wait to share my life changing experience as an IVLP participant with my team members",
  " I am proud of who I have become regardless of my past, I am grateful for amazing woman like Oprah Winfrey who has always been an inspiration to women all over the world",
  " She remains my greatest inspiration and icon",
  " I&#8217;m where I&#8217;m because seeing her every day gives me hope, she conquered so can we all",
  " I know there is a lot to do in my country before we eliminate violence against women, girls and children but I hang on to the hope that began the day I realised I am stronger than I think and amazing in many ways",
  " I won&#8217;t give up because of women like my mother who suffer domestic violence in marriage, no one spoke out for her",
  " I am here to speak out for them, they deserve another path of life unlike my mother&#8217;s",
  " I believe change will come when advocates like myself rise up and speak for the many women, girls and children who are oppressed",
  " I am proud to be a voice for the voiceless",
  " My book Glow after Pain amplifies my cause and has proved that not even shame or victimisation can stop me from telling my story of triumph over abuse and pain",

  " Strep got into her blood stream, causing an infection and flesh-eating bacteria called necrotising fasciitis",
  " The infection spread through her tiny body so rapidly, that they gave her a 20% chance of survival",
  " They basically prepared her father and I for her death",
  " They said she probably will not make it through the night",
  " We took her to the hospital thinking she just had the flu, so it was much to our surprise that our little girl was minutes away from dying",
  " In order to save her life, they had to amputate her left leg above the knee",
  " See, Tessa is a very success competitive dancer",
  " She loves to be on stage and was the youngest child to make the company dance team at her studio just a few months before she got sick",
  " It was heartbreaking to us to hear what was going to have to happen to our baby, but we said do anything you have to, to save our babygirl",
  " They had to cut all the infection out of her body so she has multiple skin grafts that cover the whole left side of her, almost 40% of her body is covered in scars and the skin grafts",
  " This little girl beat the odds of survival and came out stronger than ever",
  "Just weeks after receiving her first prosthetic leg she was back to dance learning to dance with her new normal",
  " She went to dance prior to getting her prosthetic leg with a walker and watched and studied all the other kids, It was so hard for her to not be out there doing what she loves but she was just happy to be there and be alive",
  " She said mom I am going to dance again",
  " I am going to tumble again too",
  " I know I can do this",
  " I said its going to be hard but I am not ever going to tell you that you cant do it, so please don\u2019t ever give up",

  "Dedication: Leigh Maneri, 100%",
  " She's the one that had that first conversation with me and got me to do it",
  "When I was younger, I grew up listening to my dad tell stories about his time as a Peace Corps volunteer in Ghana",
  " He would always tell me the importance of helping others, and of public service",
  " I always kept that in the back of my mind, hoping to be a public interest lawyer someday",
  " Unfortunately when my time came to start thinking about law school, it was 2008-2009, and we were in the midst of the recession",
  " I wondered, what could I do to help make this world a better place",
  "My journey took me to working at a domestic violence shelter, joining Alpha Phi Omega and being the VP of Service for my chapter",
  " I went to Utah and worked in financial services after graduate school, but even then I served on a nonprofit board as part of the finance committee",
  " I knew nonprofit organizations were part of my passion, but I was, at that point, still unsure of how I could best contribute",
  "It finally hit me when I was in Sahara Rose&#8217;s class geared toward helping us as a group find our life purpose",
  " I was on the phone with Leigh, a friend and participant in the class, floating a completely different idea about starting a website, and started talking to her about nonprofit consulting and grant writing",
  " She noticed right away that the way I talked about nonprofits and grant writing was totally different from anything else I had previously explored",
  " For me, it wasn&#8217;t about making a living, it was about finding my passion, and helping others to tell their story was what I was passionate about",
  " I was overcome with real happiness because I knew grant writing was the way I could help others and the way to merge nonprofit knowledge with business knowledge and help them get the job done",
  " I had finally found my place",
  "Grant Writing is more than just writing proposals to fund programs",
  " It&#8217;s about aligning passions- bringing funders together with nonprofits to build a shared legacy",
  " It&#8217;s amazing to work with the organizations I do because I see the passion they have for what they do",
  " Nonprofit jobs are often not high-paying and involve a lot of dedication, long hours and true drive",
  " The people who dedicate their time to this pursuit are true visionaries, and they&#8217;re incredibly selfless and altruistic",
  " I love working with nonprofits and telling their stories, because I truly believe they&#8217;re doing their part to make this world a better place",
  " This is what excites me, and this is why I write",

  " When I did learn it was so hard, I want to give up",
  " Everyone made fun of me when I pronounced words in English wrong",
  " The school was miserable for me, I was only 10 years old then",

  "Once upon a time there was a little girl who was very happy",
  "Life was good and I was surrounded by all my family, which was good as my mom was not a motherly mother",
  " She was often at the pub where she worked or out and about and I remember my aunts and uncles being the ones that showed me most love",
  " My mother had me at a young age and never cuddled, kissed or showed me a quarter of the love she showed my younger sister",
  " My sisters dad brought me up and to this day is the greatest man and I am so proud to have him as my dad",
  " He lived with us until I was eight or nine and I am so grateful that he did as he gave me the memories I can talk about with other people, the fond ones about the parents",
  " Not long after My mom had made him leave she brought home this man, we called him the milky bar kid",
  " He was all smiley and he stunk of aftershave he was very young looking and was around eleven years older than me, I was nine",
  " This man was called Davey Kevin James",
  "He started playing with me and my sister he was really nice, if I&#8217;m honest we quite like him",
  " This lasted about six weeks, but Mom was smitten",
  " They often went to the pub at weekends and it wasn&#8217;t long before fights happened amongst the family which he caused so he could distance Diane from the family she had always been so close too",
  " One night I woke to loud voices, it was my mom, Diane crying and Davey was shouting at her",
  " Diane was usually so vocal and extremely good at looking after herself but it sounded like she was scared",
  " I got out of my bed and saw Davey standing over my mom hitting her",
  " &#8220;Get off her&#8221; I screamed, that was the first and last time I ever got out of bed to get involved in an argument I could overhear from my room",
  "First of all let it be known that I am a survivor",
  " No matter the journey there I will survive it, what ever it takes",
  "It wasn&#8217;t long before we moved from the house we had grown up in, away from the family that loved us and close to a family I am glad to never have to see again",
  " Davey had assaulted my grandad which caused a big family feud, we were told that we were no longer allowed to talk to any of them",
  " You may think well how is that possible",
  ", but when you fear someone and their punishment you tend to do exactly what you are told",
  " As soon as we moved our surnames were changed and even though we lived in a small town we were not allowed to talk to most members of my mothers family I loved so much and always knew that if they knew what he was doing to us they could help, but yet you are always to scared, embarrassed and groomed to ever tell a soul",
  " I wish I could explain the fear but you only know it if your in it",
  " It&#8217;s a mixture of extreme shame, overpowering sorrow and a fear that it will always go that bit further",
  " Obeying the rules because the consequences of breaking them are your burden and trying to be in a mainstream school acting like a normal child when really your so messed up you just want to scream out loud but you can&#8217;t",
  " Most importantly you are the eldest sibling and the thought of leaving the others behind is the main reason that You stay silent",
  "Many factors made up the reasons why I could not tell people what was going on",
  " First of all this man was married to my mother and as the years had passed they had children together, which were always looked after by me",
  " The control he had over her was unimaginable and this control he still holds even from his prison cell",
  " I cannot go over the things I witnessed happen to my mother as she is still married to this man who raped and abused me for nine years",
  " I felt that if I had told someone and they didn&#8217;t believe or they told my step father what I had said the punishment would be awful",
  " For the first couple years my abuse was just physical and it would be a slap, a punch or a smack with the belt",
  " It wasn&#8217;t until I got to about twelve when I started to realise the relationship started to change and he would touch me in inappropriate places",
  " He would pinch my developing breasts or pull my trousers down thinking it was funny, then one day when he was play fighting with me I accidentally elbowed him between the legs to which he responded &#8220;that&#8217;s more like it&#8221;",
  " I think it was from that moment I knew his intentions and felt utterly sick and nervous",
  " This nervousness grew into a emotion that would grow immensely over the next few years and would stay with me for a very long time",
  " The more he would pretend to play the further he would push the boundaries by placing my hands into the private regions of his body and the gestures he made showed enjoyment even when I cried or showed much displeasure of what was occurring he would turn it by making out it&#8217;s what I wanted and I was just too scared to disagree as even though this sexual abuse was not happening in front of anyone the punishment for not going along with him was dished out in front of other people",
  " He would be horrible to me but extra nice to all the other kids in the house, I would not be aloud out, I would have to be the mother of the house, cook clean babysit, take the beating, having secret visits while I was in bed constant whispers of what was to come, and threats of what would happen if I did not obey",
  "2",
  "Over time I have developed a great blocking mechanism so when I look back I cannot put days, times or exact precision on any thing, I just have this massive recollection of memories that tell my story",
  " I felt for so long I could not explain it to any one else but when I did talk to the police they helped me piece together all these different recollections and finally find the courage to stand tall and tell people what I had been through",
  " If I told my story, just the truth and no lies people could form their own opinion and decide if they thought it was right or wrong",
  " I never pretend to be a saint many wrongs has it took to make me right but now I&#8217;m there I want to share it, and even if one person only was able to be inspired or helped then it has played its purpose",
  "Unconditional love is the most powerful emotion one can feel for another and it is something I have given out but never felt myself until now",
  " As a mother at the instant I knew there was life inside me an unconditional love formed finally I knew what it was and knew what a real mother was",
  " Blessed I felt, so mesmerised by the beauty I created I knew it no longer mattered that I had never received it because I could give it",
  " The strength it gave me was sensational",
  " I knew while it is in my power no harm will ever come to my children and no one who would bring harm to a child should be heard about",
  " My journey began on February 8th 2008 when I finally went forward to the police and explained to them why I felt I had been violated",
  " Their reaction helped my thought process begin to manifest into reality and realisation of what had happened",
  " You always think differently when you holding in, the thought of others reactions are unreal and drive you quietly insane but only when you open up do you realise",
  "First you realise that talking helps, well it did for me but that may not be the way for everyone",
  " When you say it out loud you begin to realise the abuse for what it really is instead of feeling it is a dirty secret you have to carry until you die",
  " The reactions of others is also something that made me become capable of opening up more and more",
  " My support network, which was small but extremely effective listened to me so many times and picked me up every time I fell",
  " I will never be able to show them the appreciation I have for what they put up with when being my friend throughout is whole time",
  " When I first decided to go forward about my childhood it was February 2008",
  " I had no idea at that time that this would lead to a three year ordeal that became the hardest battle of my life, yet he most worth while",
  " I gave a brief description at the first interview and was sent away to collect my memories ( as they were and still are very scattered) and was asked to attend a formal interview at a place where I would be comfortable and video interviewed",
  " In between this time is was so hard to remember dates and years exactly and even some of what had happened to me was so hidden away that I didn&#8217;t remember it until I started talking at the interview",
  " Floods of memories came back to me, i had hidden them deep but not deep enough thankfully",
  " After my first interview the police officers there reassured me and made me fully aware of the extent of abuse that I had suffered and I knew then that now it was time to let the authority&#8217;s deal with the information I had gave them",
  "It took a while but eventually he was charged and bailed for my allegations and those of another who had also reported him for her own childhood demons",
  " As soon as he was charged his counter action was to make out I was a liar and only looking to gain cash from all of this",
  " Random people received anonymous letters apparently from me, threatening them",
  " He tried to make out I was harassing him",
  " I won&#8217;t lie I was petrified every time I left my house and every time I went to bed, &#8220;what if he got me &#8221; went over and over in my head every minute of everyday as where we live is very small",
  " I started to have other allegations thrown back at me and was taken into the police station many times for questioning",
  " I was accused of calling Davey on the phone and trying to blackmail him for twenty five thousand pounds which of course I did not do",
  " Also allegations of me sending threatening letters to him and slandering his name, it was a long period but finally he was charged and a court date was set",
  " I would have to face him",
  "3",
  " On a personal level my life started to suffer slightly as I was scared and immature, I wanted to get drunk when my children were with their dad as I hated being alone, I started to be too scared to sleep",
  " You fall into a hole and start to sink, and I sunk and made many mistakes, always justifying them with the fact my head was a mess",
  " At this time my thoughts were so contrasted to how they are now, I chased the party, I dabbled in drugs, I did so many things just to take my mind away from what was really happening to me, none of which I can change but only make better by learning from them",
  " Which has definitely occurred, I have learned so much from my actions and their consequences and finally at thirty three feel content, and free from the albatross that was around my neck",
  "The first court case at Worcester crown court was in January 2010 and The thought of being face to face with him was petrifying and the reality of seeing my mother and siblings at the courts was the most horrible experience of all",
  " They all stood with him looking down on me with pure hatred and anger, calling me a liar, which I understood from his children as they were to young to remember but one sibling and my mother knew it was happening at the time yet they still stood at his side",
  " I justified this by telling myself that they were still under his control and they would have to tell the truth in the courtroomThis was not the way at all even when certain people swore on the bible they still lied through their teeth but that is their burden to carry now",
  " On the day I had to give me evidence I was advised to do a video link but I refused thinking that I needed to do it to his face to feel better, how wrong I was",
  " It was the most tense, vulgar feeling that it&#8217;s quite hard to explain",
  " Surreal",
  " I stood in the stand while my barrister asked me questions and then it was the turn of the defendant s barrister to cross examine me",
  " For the whole time I stood on the stand I was accused of blackmail and hardly questened about abuse just the reason s as to why I was trying to ruin an innocent man",
  " One reply that sticks in my mind was&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to destroy him, I just want to stand here today and tell my story, I don&#8217;t care if you believe me I just care that I get to stand here today and look him in the face and tell him he was wrong and I am not scared anymore&#8221;While making this statement I maintained eye contact with him until I finished my sentence, oh gosh the rush, no longer was I a little child, I had know grown stronger and become a survivor",
  " He looked straight down at his feet when I finished",
  " Then through the rest of my time being cross examined he was just stood in the dock shaking his head pretending to look like the victim",
  " He brought a massive support network to court with him, friends and family of his who constantly threw looks and comments my way it was horrendous I just wanted to run away but my support network kept me going",
  "After my evidence was given and my witnesses had given theirs it was time for him to bring his witnesses in",
  " So many lies were told it was unreal he even came to court and claimed long and short term memory loss",
  " He claimed he had suffered a head injury that had caused him to forget the last twenty years or something similar to that, so he did not remember who I was and answered every question he was asked with &#8220;I can&#8217;t remember&#8221;",
  " I sat in the public gallery thinking well I do,I remember everything",
  "It was the longest two weeks of my life at that time",
  " The jury went out and took four days to come up with a verdict which was nine votes of guilty and three vote of not guilty",
  " This caused the judge to insist upon a re trial as with this sort of case the jury must reach a majority vote which was ten votes of guilty or over",
  " The judge also ordered Davey to be assessed by court doctors for this apparent memory loss",
  " It was an overwhelming feeling as I had to do it again but nine strangers had believed in my truth and that gave me hope, but the thought of waiting in the world that he was free to roam in was terrifying as already I had been falsely accused of so many things",
  " I walked away from the courts in pieces as the journey I thought was about to end was just beginning",
  " I wish I had never gone forward at first but this emotion passed quickly, nine jurors believed me out of twelve, I could do this I had to be strong",
  "4",
  "My head fell apart over the next couple of weeks, replaying over in my mind the ordeal I would have to go through again by repeating what I had already said, and suffering the pain of the people I loved hating on me and thinking I was a liar when all I was doing was telling of my childhood memories",
  " That is the thing though, when you are telling the truth you never ever forget so every time you talk about it, the same words come out, repetitive as they are they never change but when you have lied you forget it or a detail about it and therefore it is proven and that is a brilliant reason to always tell the truth",
  " The next date was set and it was several months later, I just went wild and didn&#8217;t know if I was coming or going",
  " I between this time again I had been taken into the police station for ridiculous accusations such as vandalising vehicles, threatening letters, physically assaulting Davey and many other things",
  " I never once got charged for any of this as I had never done any of it",
  " My belief was that telling the truth was enough if people didn&#8217;t believe me there was no more I could do",
  " Every time I was accused of something I got that little bit weaker and then when the court date finally came around there was a death within my close network of witnesses and two days before it was due in court it was cancelled until another date could be made",
  " That was it for me I fell to the floor I had nothing left inside me, life had become so hard living amongst the many people he had made believe that I was victimising him",
  " How could I last any longer",
  " I had put myself into college to study a degree for the September of 2010 and really wanted this behind me before it started, but now I would have to take this with me, dazed by all this I nearly gave up but thankfully a great person picked me up as well as the most amazing police officer I&#8217;m privileged to know",
  " With out them and the others that stood strong with me I started college, maintained my motherly roles and still took all the harassment of his supporters during this",
  " I even got told I had to stay away from my local shopping centre due to falsely being accused by one of his friends of threatening behaviour",
  " It was a complete joke but I had to tip toe around for so long",
  "College started to become my get out, I threw myself into my studies especially through my second year",
  " More and more people started to believe his lies as he was showing text messages with threats that were apparently from me, and strength was hard to keep",
  " Then finally a new court date was set for May 2011",
  "5",
  "This time I had to do it different, I didn&#8217;t need to go to court every day I had heard it all before",
  " I only went to give my evidence which I did by video link this time round",
  " The night before I was due to give my evidence my kitchen windows were smashed and even though I know it was to scare me off it made me more determined to go to give my evidence",
  " It was so much easier to be natural via video interrogation",
  " This time no mention of memory loss came about I got asked questions about abuse that I could respond to naturally by just telling the truth",
  " I held my head high and I told everything even how he had got me pregnant, which he never knew until court",
  " After this I walked away and waited for the verdict",
  " It was again the longest two weeks of my life, but the wait was worth it",
  " The fact he came back to court with no mention of the memory loss or the money I was blackmailing him for must have made the judge see how manipulating he was",
  " He didn&#8217;t even attend the assessment they ordered",
  " The day the jury went out I sat with my sister all morning anticipating what could have happened then I got the call",
  "Guilty",
  " All twelve jurors found him guilty, when I got the call I was mesmerised by pure happiness",
  " Karma really does exist, all the people that disbelieved when I said I just want to tell the truth",
  " The justice system to me is excellent",
  " The help they have given me is wholly justified and they prove to me why the system is in place",
  "I went to court on verdict day, but when we got there we were told that he had gone in an ambulance to hospital with chest pains",
  " So we were sent away it was a Friday and I remember thinking were gonna have to wait ages",
  " Within an hour of getting home I got a phone call telling me it was Monday",
  " Happy doesn&#8217;t come close",
  " On the Monday at the court his network was massive so I was sat in the court next to him",
  " He looked like I used to look waiting for him to punish me",
  " Karma",
  " When the judge spoke every word was so powerful",
  " He summed up the whole three years of my life in a three minute speech",
  " He was excellent every word was so impactive",
  "Eighteen years",
  " I never expected that, but now it look back I think this,He lied so much that he sent himself to where he is",
  " People out there helped him with his lies and abuse by backing him up , especially those who lied for him because if we look at it realistically it&#8217;s like this, a man on chargers of child abuse asks you to lie for him",
  " Is that in itself not admission of there crime, I will never understand how or why they did",
  " But again those are others wrongs to deal with",
  " Still today as I write this those people still portray this as a miss justice and claim his innocence",
  " If only there was a machine that could show your memories then everyone would be able to see",
  " I thought at this time that it was the end but it wasn&#8217;t as he was not the only demon I had to overcome",
  "6",
  "In my head I truly believed that when he went to Prison Diane would be free so she could be honest",
  " She was not and still is not, and this troubled me so very much",
  " Too much time did this consume that it has got to the stage that I realise it will always hurt but I can never answer why",
  " Why she allowed it, or why she hates me so much, I cannot change this so I live with it",
  " I only make it better by making sure it does not happen with my children",
  " The way I changed the day he got found guilty is unexplainable and amazing",
  " All of a sudden I started to like myself and as time goes by I grow and what I have learnt inspires me",
  " I&#8217;m so happy at this precise time that everything seems so worthwhile",
  " I believe in destiny and you keep on searching for what you believe is your happy place until you find it",
  " If you don&#8217;t life is fake and you are never truly happy",
  " The saying that the truth can set you free is so correct",
  " I know that sometimes this is not the way for others and cannot begin to say I know how they feel as if I would have lost I think I would have been destroyed",
  "When I speak about abuse quiet normally but yet I know there are different levels it can reach",
  " Mine were to me, extreme but I give room for argument",
  " All I know is that what was, no longer exists",
  " When I was getting accused of all these false allegations it used to tear me apart it now it holds me together it&#8217;s so crazy",
  " Everything conflicts ands contrasts with how life used to be its mad",
  "You could snot speak without getting a beating so it would be best to be quiet, oh how quiet I was",
  " Everything was fake, no friends no close circle, it was easier that way",
  " No one could understand me, well no one could get close enough to",
  " But that is the problem, as you just go wild",
  " Crazy in fact as I just went mad",
  " I can actually say i have only just found myself",
  "To do this I have had to give up hope of one day having a loving mother, it&#8217;s never going to happen",
  " I would even settle for just a mother that could tell the truth but that is not going to happen either",
  " So instead I tell myself that some questions will never get the answers I seek and I just have to get over that",
  "I make life better now by never allowing anyone to disrespect me and most of all by not disrespecting myself, I try to make sure I&#8217;m open, honest and most of all happy",
  "Sometimes I feel sad about the family I have lost but then I look at the family I have created and a warm glow fills my body",
  "After the court case I automatically assumed life would be good straight away but it still took a while to adjust",
  " College was going really well and I had made some really good friends a couple will be lifelong friends",
  " Even my tutors were so very supportive",
  " My grades improved dramatically and I ended up applying to four universities",
  " I took a place at Newman s university and have been there since",
  "7",
  "It has been nearly three years now and life just gets better by the day",
  " Obviously there are factors out there still that try to bring me down like the women who gave birth to me still carries on her married life to Davey while he is in prison, and she still continues to tell others it&#8217;s all a lie but she says that it is to protect her other children",
  " We live in a small town and when our paths cross I&#8217;m none existent to her but in reality I bet she is shaking inside when she sees me as her conscience must tell her how disgusting she has been, or am I looking at it wrong",
  " As she was and is also a victim so perhaps she has a story of her own",
  "I know that although I have many unanswered questions, the answers I seek may never be found and although this hurts if I was to continue to seek these answers my life will remain on hold, to move on I have had to drop this quest and tell my self even if I had the answers they probably would not help",
  "Instead I have filled myself with knowledge, gained a diploma and wrote down my feelings in poetry",
  " Slowly but surely the badness has been removed from my life and I sit here writing this feeling very proud of myself, something I never thought I would feel",
  "I have mentioned that I have made mistakes because of what was happening to me I never want it to be misunderstood as an excuse",
  " When you become a mother you should not do drugs or have people around your house drinking and I will always feel shame for that but now I&#8217;m not carrying the demons as I was back then, now there is no excuse, now is time to shine and help my children shine",
  " I feel like I never had a childhood and I became free at the age of twenty six so I tried to live out a life that was not suitable but now I am strong all I want is to create memory&#8217;s that my children will always treasure",
  " I have found the man I have always been searching for, the love I always knew was out there for me",
  " I kissed many frogs to find my prince and now I have I feel like I can conquer anything, I can be who I really am and he loves me for everything I am",
  " He helps me shine and for the first time I feel that someone loves me unconditionally, at last",
  " I&#8217;m not being a loved up women when I&#8217;m saying this I&#8217;m saying it as it is the greatest lesson I&#8217;ve learned",
  " I always believed I was worth more, that&#8217;s what has always kept me going, when I have fell down I have got back up because I knew one day I would find what i pictured as true perfection",
  " Every relation ship has always had something missing, I have always had love for people but only for one thing or another, not enough to carry an eternal bond ( except for my children of course) not until now",
  " So now is my time to put my past to bed and that is why I&#8217;m writing this to share with others and finally get it out of my head once and for all",
  " I don&#8217;t want to talk about it, and I don&#8217;t want it to hold me back anymore",
  "8",
  "On my journeys I have met many different people and had many different friends, all were there for a reason and all taught me many lessons good and bad",
  " Now I have only the people around me that I love and love me back",
  " I have a loving, happy home with no negative vibes and the greatest friends a girl can ask for",
  " This privilege I have earned through living bad learning from all that has happened",
  " I still have a great journey ahead of me but now it&#8217;s exciting and everyday I wake with a smile",
  " Opportunities are all around if you are willing to work to get them",
  "I have got lost throughout my life so far and times when I self medicated with drugs and alcohol and during this time I thought I was helping myself but really I was delaying the break down",
  " I suppressed all my real thoughts and anxieties and delayed the getting over it period",
  " Now I have grown up somewhat, I have managed to deal with my demons by getting over them",
  " For this I thank my children, my partner and my family",
  " All of who have witnessed me change and grow",
  "Now I educate myself by having an eclectic range of individuals in my life, all of whom teach me different things",
  " I never knew I could feel this strong, this happy, but I do",
  " Best of all I am no longer scared, I do not fear what others think or let it dictate my life, I move forward proud and strong and am so excited at what my future holds",
  " The truth has set me free now it is the traits I picked up I concentrate on losing",
  " For example being so jumpy and scared, thinking everyone is talking about me and hoping everybody likes me",
  " I am what I am if I&#8217;m unlinked so be it I am also loved",
  " Thirty three years young and the future is so bright",

  "Hi",
  " I am a 14 year old girl in her freshmen year in high school",
  " Through the past few years I questioned my sexuality because I fell head over heels for my best friend who is a girl",
  " I never told her my feelings and never came out",
  " I don&#8217;t want to regret something that&#8217;s not real",
  " I feel like I&#8217;m not gay and this is just an early phase to my adulthood",
  " So to organize my feelings for her I wrote a letter to her",
  " And since I will never give this letter to her I decided to share it with the world",
  " I hope you like it and by the way I changed the names, for some privacy with me and my crush",
  " I also shortened the letter a bit because it was kinda personal and hella long",
  " Hope you like and it and enjoy",
  "A Letter to HerJuly 17 2018(edited on August 5 2018)(edited on August 14 2018)Dear Y,Hello",
  " That\u2019s a good starting, right",
  " Anyway, I\u2019ve been inspired to finally write a letter to you",
  " If you were wondering, I was inspired from a Sope fanfiction, Soap on wattpad",
  " This is a 1,215 word letter about the past three years we had together in middle school",
  " I\u2019m writing this letter to you, only you",
  " I don\u2019t know if I will ever have the courage to give this letter to you, but if I do I hope you accept this",
  " And for in advance I\u2019m sorry for my poor lack of English",
  "Do you remember when and how we met",
  " We met in 6th grade",
  " I remember",
  " We had three classes together, Math, Gym, and Band",
  " Math; we always worked together and compared our test scores",
  " It was fun watching your face when I would always get the higher test grade",
  " Gym; if we had someone to choose for a teammate, we always chose eachother",
  " Every single day before class started we sat up on the stage together and chat about almost anything",
  " Band; I sat first chair for once",
  " All I can remember is you raising your hand for every question, saying I can do that, play this scale, play this piece, do anything because you were that amazing",
  " I knew I wanted you to become my friend",
  " No, I knew we were going to be friends, best friends",
  " It was in gym class when we were wrestling and you were making your funny low pitched sounds",
  "I had a lot of fun with you in the past three years",
  " From school to orchestra to solo and ensemble festival",
  " When I received my result in the beginning of the year saying I was not qualified for concert band, I was devastated (meaning I cried off like two pounds)",
  " But not as devastated when I found out you were accepted into concert band, meaning we would be separated, meaning that I would not have a reason to see you outside of school",
  " One reason I didn\u2019t join flute choir was because I knew you weren\u2019t going to be there",
  " The good news is I was on the waiting list for concert band and we were together after all",
  "Let\u2019s jump to ensemble festival",
  " Prepping for festival was a lot of fun",
  " I would get so excited to come over to your house and see you",
  " To be honest it was fun practicing together and going to you private lessons mostly because you were beside me",
  " My favorite memories are playing osu, petting your cat,and watching kpop videos with you",
  "To be completely honest right now, I got into kpop exactly when you did",
  " After you posted Happy Birthday Taetae",
  " Right when I first saw it, I searched up who Taetae was and found out he was a member of a kpop group named BTS with his stage name V",
  " That very day I started forcing myself to know everything about BTS",
  " I didn\u2019t want you to figure out you were the reason I got into kpop so I never exactly told you",
  " But as the year went by I started to give out clues and hints",
  " And thank you so much showing me kpop because to be honest kpop is now my life",
  "You\u2019re probably wondering why I remember all of this",
  " I remember all of this because that\u2019s how much you impacted my life",
  " You were different from my other friends, Y",
  " You gave me excitement and passion",
  " But on the other hand you gave me sadness and fear",
  " I try my best to be calm and chill",
  " But whenever I talk to you, see you, or read your texts I get a butt load of butterflies because I\u2019m always so scared of how you see me, as a friend or more",
  " I\u2019ve been so confused on what all these complicated feelings secretly mean",
  " So I\u2019ve been holding in these feelings because I\u2019m not sure how people would react and most importantly how you would react",
  " But it has come the time where I\u2019m tired of holding in these feelings for you",
  " I\u2019m tired of these feelings getting in the way of our friendship",
  " I\u2019m tired of these feelings stressing me out",
  " So let me confess my feelings to you by writing it out",
  " Here I go",
  "Y, you mean so much to me",
  " You inspire me",
  " I love your laugh, your smile, your long, thick, black, hair",
  " I love you braveness of how you never get sad or mad; and when you do, you take revenge like the badass you are",
  " You might be fearless, but you still have your cute soft side",
  " When you make ur kawaii faces and sounds or draw your anime",
  " I love when you make your diy crafts and watching you pet rosy",
  "When did I get all these feelings",
  " 7th grade, after the concert",
  " After you rested your head on my shoulder and fell asleep",
  " I always thought as myself as striaght, marrying a man and having kids",
  " But as time went on I realized you were different, no, I was different",
  " Every single day I have wanted to hug you close to where we share our body heat",
  "I love when you would randomly hug me from behind",
  " I love when you would grab my hand for my warmess",
  " I love how you would stare at me with you beautiful eyes",
  " I love when you rest your head on my shoulder",
  " I love when we switch flutes",
  " And I also love when we switch glasses",
  " I love that the first text you always send me is B",
  " I love when you would play with my hair",
  " Why you never knew this before",
  " Because I\u2019ve been holding it in for the past years",
  " I\u2019ve been so scared to let out my feelings for you",
  " I never knew how you would react",
  " Weather you would get mad, sad, confused, or happy",
  " Anyway, I would hate myself for either letting out my feelings or for holding them in for so long",
  "You make the world disappear where I only see you, only you",
  " Everyday, every second I think about you",
  " I wanted you and me to become closer",
  " So yes, you got me into web comics",
  " Yes, you got me into drawing chibi",
  " Yes you got me into fanfiction",
  " Yes you got me into k-pop",
  " Yes you made me work hard on improving my tone",
  " And yes you changed me",
  "You, Y changed my life",
  " Moving on, you, Y changed my sexiulality",
  " Sometimes I love you, so much",
  " I\u2019m sorry for my feelings for coming in the way of our friendship",
  " I mainly wrote this letter not only to spill my feelings for you but to give you a valid reason why I\u2019ve been acting the way I have been",
  " I understand if you don\u2019t accept me or ignore me or hate me",
  " But I hope we can be Sope or maybe even the Sope in the fanfiction",
  " In other words, I hope we can still be friends",

  " It was 1994 when I was born in a small village called Aihai what is under Sapahar thana and Naogaon-6560 district very close to India",
  " My father is a farmer and mother is house wife",
  " We have got three brother and no sister, I&#8217;m the 2nd",
  " As I can remember when I was going to school as a baby class student then it was very hard time for our family",
  "Time was like very critical to live and get food three times in a day",
  " It was going like this, when I was in class four then my father said enough, you don&#8217;t need to study more",
  " Stop it and work as a cowboy",
  " That time even I was not getting a light (Lantern) properly to read in the evening due to Kerosene oil as my father wasn&#8217;t agree to buy Kerosene for my study as he hadn&#8217;t enough money",
  "After listen to stopping my studies from my father I was shocked, I was thinking in that time what I will do",
  " I never can work as a cowboy",
  " Then I was used to work beside study",
  " Getting less time for school and study as working as a cowboy",
  " I had been saying to my father there is a scholarship in class five by the govt",
  " please give me a chance if I achieved that I will continue study otherwise I will stop forever",
  "My father said okay you can but beside working as a cow boy",
  " I had been said okay",
  " So beside working as cowboy I did my study as well though I got less time",
  " Next year (2004) I am class five and the candidate to attend the scholarship",
  " I attended and got the General Grade scholarship",
  " Then my father was very happy to see my success as all people around our village was keep saying your son is very talent don&#8217;t stop him to study",
  "Okay in 2005 I am in class Six and 11 years old",
  " As I got the scholarship that is why govt",
  " provide me a small fund (300tk",
  ") monthly basis for 3 years",
  " Then I used work in paddy field in seasonally and earn some money to maintain my costs like books, exercise books, pant, shirts and so",
  " Time was like I was wearing only shirt and part for year",
  " It was 2008 and I am in class Eight",
  " Father again said stop studding and work in filed with me for others",
  " I said no, there was another chance for scholarship in class Eight I don&#8217;t want to miss that chance to achieve that",
  " Again I said if I got scholarship in class Eight I&#8217;ll continue study otherwise work with you in field for others",
  "In that time my maximum school friends owned a by cycle but in my case not",
  " I never mind for that, always thought I will by one day by myself",
  " Times going and I attended the scholarship but I didn&#8217;t get it for couple of marks",
  " Now it&#8217;s time to stop my study and start working in field with my father",
  " But people in our village and teacher said to my father don&#8217;t stop him",
  " It&#8217;s a mistake",
  " Next time in SSC (Secondary School Certificate) he will do the best, my father got agreed by pressure of villagers and teachers and said okay but work in field seasonally and continue study",
  "Time was going too fast and I reached in Class TEN (2009) and final exam will held by January 2010",
  " I was going to school and taking preparation to make a glorious result",
  " Time was like not enough money to buy Kerosene Oil and I was getting some help from people and school teacher to buy Kerosene and exercise book",
  " One other thing I was a full free student in the school for fees",
  " In 2010 time for final exam of SSC and I have to make a glorious result for sure",
  "I had attended the exam and got GPA 5",
  "00 Out of 5",
  "00 (A+) from general science group",
  " I was the only one in our batch to got GPA 5",
  "00 among 60+ students",
  " After that my family, villagers, teachers was very happy for my result",
  " Now it&#8217;s time to get admitted in college but my father hadn&#8217;t enough money to bear the cost and he had nothing to say, I got it and think that my father is not capable to bear the cost I know",
  " From where he will get the money",
  " I know all the condition and situation of my family",
  "I got out from home one day with (257tk",
  ") and one of my teacher gave me 200tk",
  " in total 457tk",
  " I had",
  " I had an uncle by village who lived in the District Naogaon",
  " I went to him and said everything and he said he will take care me",
  " Then I got admitted in a Govt",
  " Polytechnic Institute by merit for 4 year diploma course in computer technology and started studding",
  " In that time uncle provided me some money to purchase a bed and settled in a student mess",
  " I got settled but I had nothing like a phone, well dress and so",
  " In a week I was getting 35-50tk",
  " from uncle",
  " Time was like there is not a single penny as pocket money and passed lots of days without having food",
  "September 2010 I started college in first semester and wasn&#8217;t able to pay semester fees like 650tk",
  " then I applied for a fund in the college and got the fund through my result to do registration for free",
  " I was in Computer technology and I hadn&#8217;t a computer even a mobile",
  " I used to see my friends computer",
  " My father used to sending me a little amount of money in that time to live in mess",
  " Then I started searching tution from door to door",
  " I got one and salary was 150tk",
  "/Month then got another one in next month 700tk",
  " for a family four children",
  " My total month cost was 3000tk",
  " but I was getting 1600tk",
  " &#8211; 2000tk",
  "Day by day I was getting more students and I used to continue with 6 home with 6 students",
  " One home = 1",
  "20 hours then another home again another home in 6 different places",
  " I used to wake up in the morning 5AM and fresh and go for tution to student home",
  " In morning there was 3 students I means I was going to 3 home one after",
  " Now I earn good to live and maintain studies",
  " I started sending a little to home to my parents every month",
  "But I hadn&#8217;t a computer",
  " One other thing I forgot to mentioned that is when I was in class Eight then I have been seen a news in a newspaper that someone is earning 35k/month working from home with a computer I took decision in that day, one day I will do that as it inspired me more and I was walking towards computer to fill up my dreams and got admitted in computer technology",
  " But I don&#8217;t have a computer in that time",
  "I started to go to a Cyber cafe and talked with the owner and tell the truth and said I want to learn something about online earnings",
  " He said as you are poor so I can help to use my computer but there is a condition you will have to work here too, like taking bills from customer and when there will be a free computer then you can work",
  " I said okay I can do that",
  "Time was like this and I was keep practicing in the Cyber Cafe",
  " So I had no time to go to college and attend classes",
  " I went college for only one semester after that I was busy with Tution and learning online based works",
  " I was only going to attend the exam in the college in time per semester",
  " Then by tution I get an offer to work in a coaching center as a teacher for Three to Eight class students and I started that",
  " Then my life was like 5AM &#8211; 10AM tution to 3 homes",
  " 11AM &#8211; 2PM in Cyber Cafe, 3PM &#8211; 6PM coaching, 7PM &#8211; 11PM another 3 homes for tution, 12AM &#8211; 5AM sleeping hours",
  "So by coaching I got a colleague and get introduced with his one of friend who had small sister to tution and I leave one and get a new one",
  " My new students brother was a student in LAW in the capital Dhaka",
  " He was a professional freelancer too",
  " After introduced him and said everything about me he was happy and said I have an old computer if you want that I can give you for free to learn your works",
  " I said yes",
  " I got that after one month he sent it to me from Dhaka",
  " Now I have computer but no internet connection, then the Cyber Cafe owner whom I called brother gave me a modem for 15 days and recharge it by 2GB for 1 month",
  " 2GB was not enough for one day in computer but I used it for 1 month so only for learning",

  "One fine day I picked my daughter and walked out",
  " I had to stay at my mom&#8217;s place (yes the same place I had once left)",
  " For around 5months I stayed there and we went through counselling in women cell",
  " He apologized and I thought of giving him a chance",
  " One of the reason for giving him another chance was also that something inside me was not comfortable at my mom&#8217;s house",
  " Sometimes she would bring up past and taunt me for various things",
  "So I went back with him, since then I have tried my level best to drag him out of betting",
  " I gave him money twice to start different business but because of his betting no business would be successful",
  " I got him a car on installments, to be attached with OLA cabs",

  "By Christine Sayo and translated by Paul Nganga MutuaVery few people recognize the role that women play in environment conservation",
  " Research shows that women are more heavily impacted by climate change and natural disasters",
  " Yet, the media seems more keen to portray women as vulnerable victims of environmental disasters and rarely highlights the many innovative solutions that women &#8211; especially young women &#8211; are using to combat climate change",
  "In 2016, I attended the Africa Summit for Women and Girls in Tech Conference in Accra, Ghana",
  " I was amazed by how many women and girls were leading various projects in technology",
  " I was in awe as so many incredible speakers took to the podium to share their initiatives on making technology more friendly for women and girls",
  " I too wanted to do something to make a difference in society through tech",
  " My interest was sparked",
  "It was around that time that the Lets Do It (LDI) Foundation was looking for someone to lead their operations in Kenya",
  " The position required someone with knowledge and skills in environment and technology to lead a project on data collection and mapping of trash points in order to inform clean up activities across the country",
  " I did not hesitate to take up the position when they offered",
  "It&#8217;s been over a year now and I can confidently say this is one of the most fulfilling things I have ever done",
  " My first task as the country coordinator for LDI Kenya was to test out the app",
  " It was a really exciting to feel part of a crew that was working to change the world",
  " Being able to contribute ideas and feedback for the app and eventually see the final product &#8211; the World Clean Up app &#8211; was an incredible experience",
  "Being a young woman in leadership has not been smooth sailing, though",
  " There is pressure to always deliver the very best",
  " Society tends to put women in leadership positions on much higher pedestals than their male counterparts so that one misstep makes people quick to generalize and argue that women should not be in charge",
  " My best defense on such occasions is to ensure that my work speaks for itself",
  "Since taking on this new role, I have grown more confident and can now walk into meetings and address potential donors and partners without fear",
  " I have come to greatly appreciate the women leaders I meet, as I now understand what it means to be a woman in leadership",
  " I have met other women leading equally innovative projects and learned from their successes and challenges",
  "The greatest lesson I have learned so far is that, as a woman, if you are offered a platform to lead, it is important to use it as an opportunity to open doors for more young women to join you",
  " I always encourage the young women on my team to attend meetings and speak out because I know how young women can be intimidated, silenced, and critiqued",
  " As young women, we need not compete with each other, but work together to break the glass ceiling &#8211; not just for ourselves, but for the generations that will follow",

  "I began to understand that my peers and I are the ones who could plant roses",

  "After my parent&#8217;s divorce, I slowly sank into a trap",
  " The trap of low self esteem",
  " Following the event, my grandma came into the picture and became the caregiver of my sis and I",
  " My grandma always dotes on my sister alot and favouritsm was obvious",
  " Everyone sees it, including my relatives but no one ever stand by me and be my voice",
  " I slowly learned that I am that unworthy and unloved",
  " People around me including my parents grew used to me being less doted on and took it for granted",
  " I eventually perceived how unworthy I am and acted that way",
  " Whether if I am in the society or in my own family, I hardly voice out for myself because I was so used to being taken advantage of",
  " I hate how I could not speak out for myself every time",
  " Now that I am entering the workforce, I realised how much I struggled to voice out for myself and for my clients",
  " Being in the social sector, I learned that I have to learn how to be a voice of my own before being a voice for my clients",
  " I am still in the process of improving myself while being a voice not just for myself but also for my clients",
  " \ud83d\ude42Thinking back, I really hope that someone is there to stand up for me, to be a voice for me",
  " It will never happened but remember that nobody deserve to be unloved and nobody is unworthy",
  " We are all loved and standing up for myself is how I show my love to myself",
  " How about you",
  " How are you going to love yourself",
  "",
  "Dedication: GodLearn to overcome my most difficult lifelong struggles",
  " Change the way I think of myself and others",
  " Those are my goals but in order to fix my problems I\u2019ve begun to face them and trace them back to where they originated",
  " As I stated looking back into my childhood and different traumas I endured or challenges I faced I was able to see and understand them, as well as my reactions to them much better now then I did when I was a child",
  "This was a painful journey down memory lane but I was beginning to see there was a benefit to going there",
  " It was not to make me feel sorry for myself but to make me feel better about myself",
  " I have spent most of my life refusing to look back because I knew it was painful and I thought it would only inspire self pity",
  " I\u2019ve always believed that being strong meant that you didn\u2019t let anything get to you",
  " If it doesn\u2019t kill you, it will make you stronger and so on&#8230; So I suppressed a lot of things",
  " I didn\u2019t deal with them at the time they happened so instead I have carried them throughout my life; always feeling weighed down by so much pain that nobody knew about",
  " I\u2019m not saying I think I should have dwelled on things but allowing yourself to be hurt and work through what you\u2019re feeling rather then pretending it didn\u2019t happen is healthy",
  "My life has been chaotic since birth",
  " I was born to a mentally ill mom and my father is unknown",
  " So my grandmother stepped in and she raised me for the majority of my childhood",
  " Though I did bounce around some as a kid, staying with different people and spent a few years in the foster care system due to school truancy and neglect on my well meaning grandmothers part",
  "My grandma was the sweetest person most people had ever met",
  " She was a strong Christian, selfless, thoughtful, compassionate, giving, and also very trusting or gullible",
  " However she was not the best parent, she rarely ever disciplined me, she gave me almost complete control over myself beginning very early in my life",
  " At a daycare center I attended at around age 4 or 5 I was acting out, I remember them threatening to talk to my grandmother about my behavior and my response was \u201cI don\u2019t care, she won\u2019t do anything about it\u201d in this one particular incident she did punish me for saying she wouldn\u2019t and that is why I remember it",
  " She was also a single parent who had already raised 4 kids of her own so I think she was just tired by the time I came around, that is my theory",
  " Whatever the reason, she was also very neglectful",
  " She allowed me to stay with people on the weekends even after she learned I had been molested over there",
  " She worked nights and I was often home alone and then sent to school dirty and sleep deprived",
  " This caused me to be bullied early in school and so begin my many problems with school",
  "Grandma felt terrible about how I was treated at school and my growing hatred for it",
  " She began fighting with the schools on my behalf and unknowingly instilled a belief in me that the school didn\u2019t like me either",
  " She blamed them for all of my struggles in school never seeing her own part in it",
  " Back then I didn\u2019t see her part in it either, I heard teachers and other people say things about my grandma and her lack of parenting and this made me very angry I loved her and she loved me",
  "I hated school with a passion, sometimes to the point that I would have rather died then go to school",
  " The school eventually called DCF on her for all of absences and from their perspective obvious neglect",
  " A case worker showed up and they began putting pressure on us for my attendance to improve and grandma to change some things",
  " Suddenly being made to go to school all the time was extremely hard for me as I had never been made to do anything really",
  " At age 12 or so I attempted suicide by taking grandmas left over pain medication from a back injury she had",
  " Soon after taking it I began to feel sick and got scared, so I told her what I had done",
  " With some help from a cousin she was able to call for help and then I spent two weeks in the hospital for mental health evaluations",
  "That was one of the hardest times in my life because I was so afraid of ending up like my mom who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia",
  " That has always been a huge concern for me",
  " Also I think that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t receive any help for struggles I dealt with because deep down I knew I was not okay but I didn\u2019t want to be labeled mentally ill in anyway",
  " I grew up hearing horror stories about my mom from different relatives who witnessed different things she had done",
  " She threw me in a road in front of on coming traffic when I was 7 months old on one of her first visitations with me",
  " She had done a lot of terrible things due to her mental illness; but I was also told about how pretty and sweet she was prior to becoming sick",
  " So this made me question whether the same would happen to me",
  " She wasn\u2019t always that way and grandma had many theories about what made her so sick",
  " In most of them she believed that it was doctors trying different drugs on her that caused her to become so mentally ill",
  " So now as a child I established a fear of teachers, schools, social workers, and doctors",
  " All these fears eventually turned into anger towards any authority figure",
  "Looking back I know I was a troubled child",
  " I wanted to stay home playing with neighborhood kids or sometimes cousins; but mostly I preferred to play alone, I had a very vivid imagination and that was my escape, all throughout my childhood and early teens",
  " When things got to hard I would just retreat to my imagination and imagine things to be however I wanted",
  " It was a place I was in control of and could not be hurt in",
  " So much time spent in fantasy land often led me to wishing things could be different for real",
  " I became a terrible liar, when I met someone new I would lie to them about almost everything; so my friendships usually didn\u2019t last long because of this",
  " I just didn\u2019t like who I was at all and did not believe that anyone would like the real me",
  " When I grew ashamed of the liar I was becoming I started to isolate myself more then ever",
  " I found a lot of comfort in animals and have always had as many pets as I could",
  " Taking care of them and having them helped me tremendously",
  "As I got older my insecurities deepened, I was afraid of most social situations; I compensated for this fear by becoming very tough and unapproachable I was mean and got in a lot of fights",
  " I was really pretending to be tougher than I was but it worked for a while",
  " I dropped out of school as soon as I was able and further isolated myself",
  " I felt worthless and was on a constant battle with depression and anxiety",
  " I was angry all the time",
  " I thought about suicide a lot but I was afraid I\u2019d go to hell",
  "I went through short periods of trying to improve my own self worth at 15 I started attending GED classes and there I met a 26 year old guy who showed interest in me which I ignored, until one drunken night while trying to impress a younger cousin, I decided to call him so that he (being old enough) could get us more alcohol&#8230; long story short that night ended with me getting raped",
  " The last bit of pride I had left was gone as well as any shred of dignity",
  " I blamed myself because I put myself in the situation that I knew was bad",
  " I knew what he wanted I just thought I could handle it",
  " I was wrong, I still replay that night and everything I did wrong",
  " Why didn\u2019t I fight him more",
  " I was scared, that in itself made me angry",
  " I told myself to toughen up, it\u2019s happened to a lot of woman, they\u2019re fine, you\u2019ll be fine",
  " My cousin got scared (I think she knew) and called her mom",
  " I lied to everyone to protect myself (my pride) and said it was consensual",
  " I let him get away with it, now he is in prison for raping a 12 year old girl only 4 months after me",
  " I thought about how I could have prevented that from happening to her",
  " It was all to much",
  " How I wished I could go back and change it",
  "I remember feeling so hopeless, I broke down in tears one night and prayed like I had never prayed before",
  " After I said that prayer I went into the living room where Grandma was reading her Bible like she always did in the evenings and I told her how lost I was feeling and how I prayed",
  " She cried and said she was so happy to hear that, we talked for a while and then I agreed to go with her to church that evening",
  " (I hadn\u2019t been in a while) They talked about camp that was coming up (I always hated camp because I never felt like I fit in) but I decided to try camp one last time",
  " At camp I met a couple who did mission work in Africa, it was all really interesting to me for some reason and they were so nice to me, I felt loved",
  " Then they told me I could go and do that mission work with them",
  " I didn\u2019t really believe I would go but the growing friendship gave me hope enough and I was growing spiritually as a result of their friendship",
  "It was just the perfect time for God to intervene in my life and give me just enough hope to go on",
  " I did end up going to Ghana on a mission trip which impacted me and my perspective on life so much",
  " I moved into my own apartment and was doing really well in my job that I had managed to hold for 3 years at this point",
  " Soon after that I met an amazing, kind, funny, and all around great guy, my first ever real boyfriend and I came to love him very quickly",
  " I was feeling things I didn\u2019t think I would ever feel and so I married him",
  " We have been blessed with 4 beautiful girls",
  " Things were really looking up for me for the first time",
  " The only problem is that I still had all of this unresolved trauma, insecurities, and false beliefs about myself",
  " It all followed me wherever I went",
  " I learned to live with it the best I could but as time has gone on I\u2019ve realized how it still effects me and now my family",
  " I have a fear of intimacy and of being touched, I have to see it coming if someone is going to touch me or I have to be the one to initiate it",
  " I still struggle with anxiety and depression at times",
  " Last year my grandmother passed away",
  " I thought that was it, that was the last thing I could tolerate",
  "In spite of all of the blessings in my life now; I still had so much pain",
  " So I sought out help for the first time, I found someone in my church who was offering grief counseling and allowed myself to feel everything I was feeling, to trust someone and get it all out",
  " It was a powerful experience and though my issues went further then grief this was the first step in learning to deal with my pain rather then suppress it",
  " I have learned&#8230;",
  " It\u2019s okay to not be okay sometimes, and it\u2019s okay to talk about what you\u2019ve been through, or get professional help in dealing with things",
  " It doesn\u2019t make you weak, or attention seeking",
  " People don\u2019t judge you as hard as you judge yourself",
  " I still have a long way to go but for the first time I\u2019m talking about it and working through it rather then dragging it along",
  " Hope this helps someone somewhere, there is always hope",
  "",
  "I believe in introspection, where one digs deep in their heart to search for who they really are and what their purpose is",
  " This introspection isn\u2019t just for personal gain, but to meaningfully improve the lives of those around them",
  " This process led me to realize that girls and young women often suffer in silence",
  " This has motivated me to speak louder and begin my journey of elevating the voices of the voiceless",
  " I am eager to affect change that will make my community a better place for girls and women",
  "Menstruation is a natural phenomenon to girls and women; it has no shame",
  " Yet, even today, girls and young women in my community are still using cow dung, leaves, and unhygienic pieces of cloth during their menstruation",
  " Every month, girls miss school because they feel shy to walk the 15 kilometers to school with cow dung or leaves stuck between their legs",
  "The situation is only worsened during the day because some schools don&#8217;t have the facilities the girls need to wash themselves",
  " Teachers are often forced to send these girls home until their periods are over",
  " This is a major blow to a girl\u2019s education because missing a few days of school every month makes it hard for her to keep up with her coursework",
  " The lack of sanitary products is not only striping girls of their right to education, but also of their human dignity",
  "Many girls in my community never finish high school",
  " This is caused by society\u2019s negligence to award both girls and boys equal educational opportunities",
  " It is this negligence that has created social imbalance where most girls and women are not able to read or write coherently, while boys and men do both with ease",
  " Gender inequality limits girls\u2019 options, and it is a malicious way of making sure girls and women remain incapacitated",
  "Chimamanda Ngozie Adichie, a Nigerian novelist and my role model, once said, &#8220;culture doesn&#8217;t make people, but people make culture",
  "&#8221; This is a powerful reminder for me that my community can change",
  " The girls in my community need knowledge",
  " Knowledge will give them the power to fight gender inequality perpetuated by a culture that gives more value to boys than to girls",
  "This is why I believe that we need a new way of looking into the future, while learning lessons from the past",
  " The past makes the present coherent, and the past will remain horrible for as long as we fail to assess it fairly",
  " Equipping girls and women with knowledge will serve as a stepping stone and an antidote to gender inequality",
  "I believe that one day, girls and young women will not be trapped the same way our mothers and grandmothers were",
  " My dream is to encourage girls and young women to live the lives they desire, dream about the life they want, and break the silence",

  "The first time I was embarrassed of my period was the first moment I got it",
  " There was no pretext to that feeling of shame",
  " It was as innate as my breath",
  " There isn\u2019t anything specific from my childhood that led me to this feeling of dirtiness and humiliation",
  " It was just there",
  " I can remember wiping and wiping, urging the blood to go away",
  " I was disgusted by myself",
  "As I grew older, there were many more moments which consolidated this feeling",

  " There were the hysterical laughs and \u201cewws\u201d when my period leaked in my white trousers",
  " And, there was the look of disgust and subsequent break-up after my boyfriend felt my period during sex",

  " I had to insert and remove the device from my vagina and tip it out and see my blood up close after every use",

  " Then, after repeating those actions again and again, I became fascinated by the workings of my body",
  " I was no longer concerned about my menstrual blood",
  " It wasn\u2019t disgusting, scary, or dirty; it was incredible",
  "For me, the menstrual cup was my first step into understanding my body and its functions",
  " It was my gateway into taking ownership of my body and acknowledging all the amazing things the female form is capable of",
  " As women, we are constantly told that we are weaker and less capable than men because of our bodies",
  " We are shamed as irrational and dirty because of our hormonal and menstrual cycle",
  " The most empowering moment in my life was realizing that all of that is completely fictional",
  "The most important thing we can do as women is to love every inch of our bodies and rise above the negativity that is cast upon it",
  " Allow yourself to be empowered by every bodily function and understand the intricacies of your body\u2019s mechanics",
  " Then empower the women and girls in your life to do the same",

  "My journey as an activist and advocate for women and girls has come with many setbacks",
  " Living in a patriarchal society, where women are often associated with positions of welfare rather than leadership, has shattered many dreams",
  " To many, women have been created to be mothers and wives, and have a responsibility of taking care of the home",

  "We live at a time where there is more opportunity than ever before",
  " For some young women, the principles of feminism are encouraged",
  " They are supported in their endeavors to get an education, be professional, and be independent",
  " They are given equal opportunities with men in terms of education, employment, and inheritance",
  " But, unfortunately, this is not the case for most",
  " Despite our privileges, my generation must continue the fight for equality",
  "One thing that can help young women as they take this on is the presence of a role model",
  " I feel lucky to have a lot of good role models and examples",
  " One of them is Edith Esinam",
  " The first time I met Edith, I was so envious of her",
  " She was the embodiment of the woman I really wanted to be",
  " Her level of knowledge on the sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) issues of young women in Ghana excited me",
  " And, in a way, I saw myself in her",
  " I was so proud of her and immediately knew I needed to get to know her better",
  " The mere fact that she was a young woman who was stepping into her role as an SRHR youth advocate and ensuring that people heard her views was inspiring",
  "As I got to know Edith, she gave me a piece of advice that has stuck with me through the years",
  " She told me, \u201cYou never work a day in your life if you do what you love",
  "\u201d This is something I try to keep in mind everyday and instill in the young women I work with now",
  " I want to be an inspiration to other young women, and I try to to lead by example, especially to those coming up in the SRHR advocacy space behind me",
  "At several instances in my life, I have felt frustrated when my work was not effective due to the various challenges that exist in my community",
  " For example, there is still a predominant aspect of male dominance in our society",
  " Women are not given the opportunity and space to voice their views; the only role society prescribes to them is that of a housewife who should be seen, but not heard",
  " This is a key barrier that limits the full potential of young women",
  "During these more difficult times, I remember the advocates who came before me and repeat Edith\u2019s advice in my head",
  " I am so grateful to my predecessors who have fought &#8211; and are still fighting &#8211; for the existing spaces, platforms, and programs designed specifically for young women",
  " Were it not for them, the advocacy space would still be hostile to my peers and me",
  "And as I appreciate the advocates who paved the way for me, I also think about those who will take up this fight in the future",
  " My advice to other young women &#8211; those working in the SRHR space and outside of it &#8211; is to ensure that you are proactive and fully maximize the opportunities given to you by taking a leading role",

  " And while my relative privilege allowed me to get an education, start working, and travel independently, the \u2018do nots\u2019 list still hasn\u2019t fully disappeared",
  " The need to challenge this reality is what led me to my work as a campaigner",
  "For countless women and girls in India &#8211; especially those who are the most marginalized because of their caste, religion, ability, or class &#8211; violence is an everyday reality",
  " While there seems to be universal agreement across the world that violence against women and girls should not exist, we know that our political work to challenge patriarchy is far harder than just raising awareness about the scale of this problem",
  "Despite this challenge, I am excited that I\u2019m part of a generation of young women and trans youth who are speaking truth to power in big ways &#8211; not just on gender-based violence, but on sexual rights; politics; and social, economic, and climate justice",
  "What has struck me the most through my own work &#8211; whether it be campaigning to ensure young people\u2019s sexual and reproductive rights or pushing for justice for survivors of sexual violence \u2013 has been the importance of challenging this culture of accepting violence",
  " This is probably the hardest part, because it doesn\u2019t only have to do with laws or policies but is rather about chipping away at underlying discriminatory attitudes, beliefs, and norms",
  " And this doesn\u2019t happen somewhere \u2018out there",
  "\u2019 Challenging power and patriarchy begins literally and figuratively at home: in our houses, workplaces, schools, and streets",
  "And while this is exciting, it can also be draining",
  " As a woman, I see this culture of violence reflected in my own lived experience, and consistently challenging it can be exhausting",
  " I must keep reminding myself that while I will never stop campaigning, there may be times when the sheer exhaustion of this work takes over",
  " And this is ok",
  "So to others out there doing this work, I say take a moment to reflect",
  " Feel proud of what you\u2019ve accomplished",
  " Keep politicizing this work and reiterating that as women and girls, we don\u2019t need to be protected, but rather we need to be supported to claim the space that is rightfully ours",
  " There is still much work to be done",

  "My daughter has been applying for summer camp counsellor jobs",
  " She\u2019s been a camp counsellor the last three summers, in addition to being a lifeguard and swim instructor during the school year",
  " Pretty darn qualified",
  " So why did she phone me to ask whether she should apply for a senior counsellor position or a lower intermediate position",
  " And why did I hesitate before encouraging her to go for the senior job",
  "Both good questions with one very revealing answer \u2013 because she didn\u2019t fully meet 100% of the requirements for the senior position",
  " She met all the requirements except the first one, which she only partially met, and that\u2019s what made me hesitate",
  " I got stuck on that first requirement and was leaning toward encouraging her to apply for the lesser job",
  " Fortunately, I had been reading The Confidence Code by Katty Kay and Claire Shipman that morning and their words popped into my head",
  "I caught myself mid \u2018hem\u2019 (or perhaps it was mid \u2018haw\u2019) and told her that I was reading about a 1995 study conducted at Hewlett-Packard which found \u201c\u2026that the women working at H-P applied for promotions only when they believed they met 100 percent of the qualifications necessary for the job",
  " The men were happy to apply when they thought they could meet 60 percent of the job requirements",
  "\u201dI let all my doubt go",
  " She was probably 90% qualified for the senior job, maybe more",
  " I told her to apply for both positions and let the camp decide",
  " Why limit herself",
  " I told her that, based on what I had been reading, if she were a man in the same circumstances, she would probably apply for Camp Director",
  " She laughed and agreed and then applied for both positions",
  "The point here isn\u2019t that men will apply for jobs that they aren\u2019t fully qualified for",
  " The point is that most women don\u2019t",
  " Studies have shown that women will hold back when they doubt themselves",
  " Men are generally more bold and will forge ahead, confident that they have the ability to learn the required skills to do the job well",
  "I haven\u2019t yet finished reading The Confidence Code, but what I have learned so far has been enlightening",
  " The research and statistics show that in general, \u201cIt isn\u2019t that women don\u2019t have the ability to succeed; it\u2019s that we don\u2019t seem to believe we can succeed, and that stops us from even trying",
  " Women are so keen to get everything just right that we are terrified of getting something wrong",
  "\u201dMy daughter and I both hesitated about her applying for the senior position because we didn\u2019t want to get it \u2018wrong\u2019",
  " We didn\u2019t want her to apply for a position that she wasn\u2019t qualified for or to waste the employer\u2019s time",
  " By doing that, not only did we set unrealistic limits on her chances of excelling, we limited her chance of gaining more confidence in the future",
  "According to The Confidence Code, making mistakes and taking risks is behaviour \u201ccritical for confidence building\u201d",
  " And it\u2019s also a behavior that girls try to avoid",
  " Research shows that \u201cwhen a boy fails, he takes it in stride, believing it\u2019s due to a lack of effort",
  " When a girl makes a similar mistake she sees herself as sloppy, and comes to believe that it reflects a lack of skill",
  "\u201dFortunately, we can \u201c\u2026 change our brains in ways that affect our thoughts and behavior at any age\u201d and \u201c\u2026 with diligent effort, we can all choose to expand our confidence",
  " But we will get there only if we stop trying to be perfect and start being prepared to fail",
  "\u201dWill my daughter get the senior job",
  " I don\u2019t know",
  " But she did get an interview with the camp",
  " They didn\u2019t throw out her application because she was only 90% qualified for the position",
  " And even if they had, that would be okay, because now we both realize how limiting it would have been not to apply",
  "Hopefully, this will be a beginning step in changing the way we both think and in expanding our confidence in the future",
  " No more waiting until we are perfect or 100% up to the challenge, \u201cwhat we need to do is start acting and risking and failing \u2026 if we don\u2019t take risks, we\u2019ll never reach the next level",

  " He told me he\u2019s going to prescribe me a drug named Oratane (Isotretinoin) which I will be taking for the next 6months",
  " But before giving me the prescription, he let me signed a waiver where it was stated there that upon signing that paper, I confirmed that I am not pregnant at the moment nor planning to conceive at any given time while I am under its prescription",
  " Having that waiver presented clearly determine that the medicine is prohibited to be taken by any pregnant women or any women trying to conceive in that matter",
  " Isotretinoin belongs to Drug X &#8211; it means that if you are exposed to it while you are pregnant, there\u2019s a probability that it will cause birth defects to the unborn child and/or miscarriage",
  "I started to take medicine on the same day of check-up not considering about taking a pregnancy test first just to be on the safe side",
  " I informed my partner that I was taking the medicine and about its condition, he fussed out and asked me if I took the pregnancy test prior to taking the medication",
  " I didn\u2019t bother about it at all as I have all the signs of PMS",
  " A few weeks later and it was already way too past the expected day of my period, I started to feel anxious as I have already taken quite a few of the medicines",
  " My partner forced me to take the pregnancy test and I took the test twice and got a positive result",
  " I am pregnant",
  " I felt like I was carrying the world in my shoulder on that day",
  " We were both so frustrated we don\u2019t know what to do",
  " The only idea that we&#8217;ve come up with was to terminate the pregnancy as we were both worried about the possible effects that the medicine will have on our baby",
  " Since I will be having my vacation on the following month, we planned to consult here in the Philippines for a clinic where we can have the pregnancy terminated and found none as it is not acceptable/legal in my country",
  " Will not go into details about the rest of what happened but fast forward, my parents knew about our situation and our plan of terminating the pregnancy",
  " They listened to us with an open mind and a heartfelt compassion, they understood us and gave us their piece of advice",
  " They discouraged us about our plans",
  " We never heard any negative comments nor judgment from my parents \u2018cause they understood very well where our emotions and decisions were coming from",
  " They encouraged us to be positive about the situation and to change our worries and fears into faith, they want us to continue the pregnancy as every baby in this world is a blessing",
  " They told us to lay all our concerns to the Almighty God knowing and believing that nothing is impossible with the Lord God",
  "Still with fears in my heart, we followed my parent\u2019s advice and encouragement and I started to surrender everything to God",
  " I lay over to God my baby\u2019s life and condition constantly reminding myself that God is in complete control of everything and it His plan to bring this baby into this world through me",
  " Every day- morning, noon, afternoon and night, I talked to God and offered Him a prayer asking for His mercy and glory to protect my baby from any possible problems/complications, I persistently asked Him to look after my baby\u2019s growth and development inside my womb",
  "I removed the fears and doubts that I had believing in confidence that my prayer is being answered, so I went on to my monthly prenatal and every time my OB would check my baby\u2019s heartbeat and would tell me that it\u2019s beating very good and normal, I always feel a taste of heaven",
  " I love hearing his heartbeat, it is what I look forward to every month",
  " I am doing everything that I can to stay healthy, regularly taking my prenatal vitamins without missing a day, drinking Anmum milk morning and night and fresh milk in between, eating healthy food, vegetables and lots of fruit for my baby to be happy and healthy",
  " I can feel inside that my baby is doing well and is very healthy as he moves a lot and very active throughout the day",
  "At 24th weeks, I was scheduled to have the CAS",
  " I was so confident and so calm while waiting inside the Ultrasound Room and was so excited to see my baby on the monitor and to find out my baby\u2019s gender",
  " The OB-Gyne performing the scan checked everything from the measurement to every important fetal detail while dictating to her assistant all the information/result using terms I know nothing about",
  " I was just listening without a clue if it&#8217;s something good or something bad",
  " When the OB shifted the monitor in front of me to let me see all important parts of my baby\u2019s body (spinal cord, internal organs, and physical features) the entire time my heart was jumping out of joy",
  " She showed each part and would tell that its size and position are okay and normal, she showed me one by one and naming the facial features, she counted the fingers and toes for me, and lastly showed and revealed to me the gender",
  " On that day, God answered two of my constant prayers, to bless me a healthy baby boy and to give me a very good result about my baby\u2019s growth and development",
  " Indeed, God does wonders and miracles",
  " I feel His presence with me inside the room on that day",
  "That day, 06th August 2018, was the day God performed His miracle to my life by keeping my baby safe and sound inside my womb and not letting the medicine affect my growing baby",

  "Being a lesbian is the best thing that has ever happened to me",
  " I wish I could have imagined this possibility when I was younger, because when I was 11 or 12 years old, all I knew about lesbians were discriminatory things",
  " But when I was teenager, I discovered myself",
  " At first, of course, it was difficult; it is scary to be what people forbid or deny",
  " But over the years, I understood that the problem wasn&#8217;t me, that being a lesbian isn\u2019t bad or something to be ashamed of",
  " That was the way I found the power of my voice, my body, my feelings, and my ideas",
  "I was in high school when I decided to tell my friends, and some teachers, that I was a lesbian",
  " I became the person who knew about rights",
  " Some people from school sent me messages to tell me that they were LGBT too and wanted to come out, but didn&#8217;t know how to do it",
  " I was the one who denounced teachers who said homophobic comments",
  " When I was 17, I represented young lesbians from civil society on an advisory board led by the state government to drive attention to the issue of sexual diversity",
  " That&#8217;s the way I started my advocacy work for people\u2019s rights",
  "Today, I work for a lesbian feminist civil society organization",
  " I investigate how lesbians live, how their health services are, how they are treated, and how they exercise their rights",
  " My colleagues and I use this information to create proposals with public institutions or partners that advance the rights of of lesbians in my city, in my country, and in my region",
  "When I was a child, I never imagined that my life would be what it is now because I was never allowed to dream with freedom",
  " But I love the life that I have made for myself",
  " Unlike everything I heard when I was younger, being a lesbian has allowed me to listen to other women and value their voices, and to value my own voice",
  "Being a lesbian has allowed me to be proud of who I am",
  " It has allowed me to say &#8220;I don\u2019t want to&#8221; or &#8220;I like that",
  "&#8221; Being a lesbian has allowed me to recognize the value of difference",
  " It has allowed me to get closer to other women who are trying to build a more open, happier world where all people have a place and have rights &#8211; a world where no one imposes their own ways",
  " Being a lesbian has made me question racism, classism, xenophobia, misogyny, and other forms of exclusion",
  " Being a lesbian has made me better",
  "And I would like to tell other young lesbians that there is a wonderful world to discover",
  " There are other women like you, who are willing to dream together and make those dreams come true",

  "Ser lesbiana es lo mejor que me ha pasado en la vida",
  " Desear\u00eda haber imaginado esa posibilidad cuando era m\u00e1s joven porque cuando ten\u00eda 11 o 12 a\u00f1os, todo lo que sab\u00eda de lesbianas eran cosas discriminatorias, pero en la adolescencia descubr\u00ed qui\u00e9n era yo",

  " Pronto me convert\u00ed en la persona que sab\u00eda de derechos humanos",
  " Algunas personas de mi escuela me mandaban mensajes para contarme que eran LGBT y que quer\u00edan salir del cl\u00f3set, pero que no sab\u00edan c\u00f3mo hacerlo",
  " Yo era qui\u00e9n denunciaba al profesorado que hac\u00eda comentarios homof\u00f3bicos",
  " Luego, cuando ten\u00eda 17 a\u00f1os, fui representante de sociedad civil ante el gobierno del Estado, como lesbiana joven, en Consejo Consultivo de la Direcci\u00f3n de Atenci\u00f3n a la Diversidad Sexual",

  " Hoy amo la vida que he construido para m\u00ed",
  " A diferencia de todo lo que o\u00ed cuando era m\u00e1s joven, ser lesbiana me permiti\u00f3 escuchar a otras mujeres y valorar sus voces, valorar mi propia voz",
  " Ser lesbiana me ha hecho estar orgullosa de lo que soy",
  " Ahora puedo decir \u201cno quiero\u201d o \u201cs\u00ed me gusta\u201d",

  " Ser lesbiana me ha hecho cuestionarme el racismo, el clasismo, la xenofobia, la misoginia y otras formas de exclusi\u00f3n",
  " Ser lesbiana me ha hecho mejor persona",
  "Si pudiera decirle algo a otras lesbianas j\u00f3venes, les dir\u00eda que hay un mundo incre\u00edble por descubrir en el que otras mujeres como ustedes, estamos dispuestas a so\u00f1ar juntas y a volver esos sue\u00f1os realidad",

  "Dedication: To any girl out there that experiences hardship in a romantic relationship - you can get through anything life throws at you",
  "It all started back in 2016, harmlessly swiping on Tinder the social dating app, when I swiped right to someone who I could see had tattoos which looked really appealing at the time",
  " That was all I wanted, someone with tattoos and a good body &#8211; what could go wrong right",
  " That was my instant moment of regret",
  " I had swiped with a 23 old male, who went to my primary school so it was as if we were destined to meet and had a common ground",
  " He took me on a date (Rock and Rose) to be precise, ordered some champagne and was certainly flashing the cash, and picked me up in a Mercedes",
  " I liked the sound of him already",
  " From that day on, we spoke everyday, I introduced him to my mum and before long he was my boyfriend, ultimately living in my summerhouse at the bottom of the garden where I stayed",
  "I was aware that he had been in prison back when he was younger for certain things, but my profession within Social Services enabled me to see the good in him at the time and that the past is the past and people change",
  " I remember him buying me a Louis Vuitton purse for Christmas and I thought he treated me really well",
  " I distinctly remember him saying that he could make people do anything he wanted but I was so wrapped up that little did I realise the manipulation and despair I was about to experience",
  "At the time when we met, he was working at a local studios on film productions",
  " As time went on, he started not going to work and it seemed he lived at mine, living of my money and taking it all for granted",
  " He also seemed to have a lot of cash and it seemed his job paid well, but it seemed that he quickly lost all of his motivation to work and make a living for himself",
  " The saddest thing was, I did not even question this and assumed that after some time he would be back on his feet",
  " We had seemed to have drifted into a routine, like most couples do and I seemed stuck with a man who little did I know was too dangerous for my own good",
  " My dad had gone off travelling for around six months and my mum could be fairly naive, so there were no red flags at the time",
  "A few weeks after we were dating, I remember him saying that he had such a poor credit score due to being in prison previously, that he was going to ask a friend to get a car out for him and then pay him back every month",
  " Little did I know, I would be that person who carelessly walked into a car dealership and signed on the dotted line for a Mercedes E class worth over 20,000 pounds",
  " We spoke about the idea, that I could potentially help him as he was my boyfriend but everything went from 0 to 100 miles an hour in a short space of time",
  " I remember, it was me who drove to his sky dive when we first met, it was me that drove us everywhere, because he relied on me as he had nothing of his own",
  " This was just before Christmas, I thought I was being a good citizen, giving someone a helping hand and I trusted him to pay me back every month",
  " I remember the countless promises that I could be insured on it, we would go to Australia and he even bought a magazine from the shop once and told me to pick a country, which was where we would go on holiday, but I was let down, constantly",
  "At first, the I saw the money for the repayment of the Mercedes which was around 530 per month and I content &#8211; I knew he would stick to his word",
  " It was not longer after that I wanted a new car for myself, so again, I walked into a dealership and signed my life away for a brand new Mercedes C Coupe worth over 30,000 pounds",
  " I did not even look at the overall price at the time, but as I had landed myself in a successful job, I somehow thought I was powerful and could do anything",
  " I was over the moon, with a brand new car I had no worries in the world",
  " Until, he stopped making payments for the car, he made excuses and then broke up with me as he went back to his ex",
  " I remember lying to my parents that he got it for himself and no one knew my dark secret that I had essentially got a car out for someone who I barely knew",
  " As time went on, we got back together and I remember the stressed I endured every month of not knowing whether he would pay rightly for the car fee that he said he could",
  "Not long after, the car disappeared, he stated he lent it to a friend and it went missing",
  " At the time, shockingly, I took his word for it and did not think anything of it as he still agreed to make the monthly payments",
  " My friends describe me as being a different person, almost like I was under a spell of control and naivety",
  " I was now one car down and I remember giving endless amounts of cash to him, when he said he needed some as he was arrested out of town for anti social behaviour",
  " He also stated that he was in an open prison because of this, where he could come out at night so again was restricted with money",
  " I distinctively remember dropping 250 off under a cone at the local train station, because he needed it for some reason for another",
  " I felt bad and emotionally drained that someone who was supposed to be my boyfriend was now back in prison and I had very little control over the situation",
  " I also remember me telling him I was planning on clearing my credit card as it was due, and to my dismay the 1500 I cleared off had gone back up past its limit, when I called up the bank to realise someone committed fraud on my card",
  " To this day, I believe it was him (there were multiple transactions near his work) and I had to fight the financial obudsman to get that money back which took about 8 months",
  " It seemed to be an endless cycle of me getting upset, giving him money and it repeating all over again",
  " My Dad, who was now back at home was not happy with this and he had an instinct that he was not a good guy, hid all his valuables as he did not trust him and forbid him from coming into the house",
  " That was when I decided to still be with him and stay endless nights at his fathers house so I could be with him",
  " Then my birthday was coming along and he got me two black cats, who he stated were dwarf cats",
  " I was so happy and ecstatic but I soon realised they were just normal cats and looking back it seemed it was a lie upon a lie",
  "The car bill was mounting up, and I quickly realised I was using my savings every month to pay for it as he did not have the money or made some excuse, on top of my own car which amounted together of about 1000 per month",
  " Little did I realise that him being in an open prison was all a lie, and he was actually being unfaithful to me with someone else who I got in touch with some months after we had broken up",
  " Not only was he a compulsive liar, a money stealer and an unfaithful man, he was a criminal who exploited me out of money and I had to pick up all the pieces",
  " I was always scared of not being around his company because of the financial tie we had with the car",
  "The final straw was when we were no longer together, he broke up with me again for one reason or another and I was in a vulnerable state and ended up talking to someone he knew of",
  " Word got out and before I knew it, he smashed my Mercedes up with a base ball bat",
  " I was devastated and it went to court",
  " On top of that, I was faced with the harsh reality that a car I got out for someone out of the goodness of my heart, had disappeared and there was no guarantee he would pay the monthly payments",
  " I was living a lie for the 6 months we were together and I had to face up to the truth",
  " I felt betrayed",
  " I remember writing my parents a letter of the ordeal I had been through before I left for work, hoping that somehow they would be there to help me pick up the pieces",
  " They were extremely supportive and I realised I was in around 22,000 worth of debt",
  " My mum kindly got a loan out for me to reduce my monthly payments, which was a 5 year plan that I still pay for every month",
  " My car was off the road for about 4 months and cost 12,000 worth of damage, where I lost my no claims at the time",
  " Thankfully, over a year later, he admitted to the malicious damage and was sentenced to 12 months in prison but the emotional turmoil I experienced of preparing for court was one I will never forget",
  " I had to drive a Skoda for this time period which really damaged my ego to say the least",
  " I still experience problems with my car now, such as the panoramic roof broken and I am currently fighting with my insurance company and ombudsman about this as I believe it was not properly fixed from before",
  " I feel it is a bad omen, which relates to the past when I was with him and I would now do anything to have the car gone and traded in for something else",
  " At the time, I was working full time and studying for a degree, and I will now graduate with a 1st class honours in September",
  " I have progressed in my career and he has not dampened my dreams of becoming a Social Worker",
  " This experience nearly broke me but with the support of my friends, family and manager I was able to come through the other side",
  " I have learnt very valuable lessons about fighting for what you believe in and not trusting so easily, as well as money can come and go",
  " I remember the feeling that my life was now over",
  " I value my determination and my resilience to get back up on my feet, for someone else this may have broke them",
  " I am still very much re paying back money from this situation but I am stronger now and I hope that this story may inspire others",

  "Dedication: To all the girls and young women who shared their thoughts with me",
  "My story is I do my activism with my writing",
  " Since I couldn\u2019t find a book about global young women\u2019s activism, other than regional studies, I traveled to hot spots for democracy uprisings like Cairo, Istanbul, and Athens to talk with the new generation of feminists, struck by their courage",
  " I surveyed or interviewed over 4,000 young people from 80 countries and reported on what they said in six books such as &#8220;Ageism in Youth Studies",
  "&#8221; Part of series on youth activism, &#8220;Brave: Young Women\u2019s Global Activism&#8221; is available as a two volume inexpensive eBook since I think books should be affordable, as well as in paper",
  " Many of the video interviews are available on the TheGlobalyouth YouTube channel",
  "Here\u2019s an example of a teenager I interviewed for Brave",
  " Why would Yara, a middle-class girl living in Cairo, risk her parents\u2019 disapproval and worry, as well as her life, by demonstrating daily in Tahrir Square in 2011",
  " Conducting \u201chistory from the bottom,\u201d that is, listening to those who are not famous \u201cgreat men,\u201d to find out what influenced an activist teenager, I interviewed Yara on Skype and in emails in 2013 and 2014 (see video)",
  " She describes her experiences as a revolutionary",
  " Yara\u2019s mother is very religious and wears hajib headcovering, but Yara is an agnostic who doesn\u2019t cover her hair, and is not constrained by traditional religious beliefs that girls should stay at home (influence 1)",
  " She doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to condemn someone to hell just because they don&#8217;t have certain religious beliefs",
  " As a scientific person, she believes in Newton\u2019s law of conservation of energy, which she says can be called God",
  " Her parents\u2019 education and class status enabled her to get a good education what supported her activism (her class background and education is influence 2)",
  " Like her mother, Yara is a \u201cscience geek\u201d who would like to major in physics or astronomy when she enters university",
  "Yara said the January 25 revolution wasn\u2019t made by the hungry, but was led by well-educated people like herself in a country where over a third of females and 18% of males are illiterate",
  " More than 35% of middle-school students ages 12 to 15 are illiterate due to large class sizes and inadequate teacher education",
  " In rural areas girls leave school early to get married, which is in stark contrast to Yara\u2019s urban education, and two million women have never been in school",
  " Unlike village girls, her father keeps Yara informed about political issues, and most of her school friends also had no idea what was going on; they didn\u2019t even know about leaders like Mohamed ElBaradei who floated the idea of a presidential campaign",
  " Her friends simply talked rather than acting, so she thought she would have to leave Egypt to order to make a difference",
  " She said many people supported dictator Hosni Mubarak because he was a familiar father figure",
  "Yara was 14 and 15 when she went to the streets and slept in a tent in Tahrir Square during the January 25 revolution, although Egyptian girls do not sleep in mixed sex gatherings",
  " She knows martial arts, so the last man that tried to sexually harass her ended up with a broken hand (not being afraid and being angry is influence 3 on Yara\u2019s brave activism)",
  " She saw people killed by police gunfire, including one of her friends",
  " Their deaths made her want to complete their goals even if it meant she would also be killed",
  "Yara and many of her peers around the world abhor the traditional cycle they are taught to follow: go to school, get into a good college, do a boring job, marry and have kids",
  " They\u2019re ambitious and give each other courage to rebel through their global social networks (influence 4 on her motivation)",
  " Yara is deeply involved in Harry Potter books and films, the British hero and role model who routinely defies authority and succeeds",
  "Yara views herself as strong-willed and altruistic: \u201cI\u2019m the passionate outspoken girl, who will tell you exactly what\u2019s on my mind",
  "\u201d She views herself as full of contradictions such as, \u201cI\u2019m the shy, awkward kid, who still steps up to steer",
  " I\u2019m the introverted social butterfly",
  " I\u2019m the girl who believes that helping people is her solitude",
  " I\u2019m the hotheaded politician who still believes in Utopia",
  " I\u2019m the down-to-earth type of person who refuses to take a back seat",
  "\u201d As the first-born in her family with a younger sister and brother, Yara is expected to achieve (influence 5)",
  " She\u2019s determined to do well\u2014a trait often associated with high-achieving firstborns",
  "A pattern for successful women is having an appreciative father whom the girl identifies with, rather than the mother",
  " Yara\u2019s encouraging relationship with her father is similar to Malala Yousafzai, as described in her autobiography I Am Malala (2013)",
  " Malala\u2019s father said in the feature film He Named Me Malala (2015), \u201cWe\u2019re one soul in two bodies",
  "\u201dAfter the Tunisians succeeded in expelling their corrupt president, Egyptian youth gained the confidence to take action",
  " Yara reported, \u201cPeople felt and understood we are the power",
  "\u201d (Hope is influence 7",
  ") She thought of the Egyptian people as uneducated, but after the demonstrations she saw a different side of people as she stood side by side with girls who were on the front lines and with Christians and Muslims guarding each other during prayers",
  " After January 25 she witnessed great positive energy as people cleaned up the square and painted the walls; she observed, \u201cEveryone was trying to do something",
  "\u201dYara was in Tahrir Square on January 25th, the first day of the 2011 revolution, right after she took an exam in her high school",
  " She was involved previously with political groups like the April 6 Youth Movement and had some connections with the administrators of the We Are All Khaled Said Facebook page",
  " That page changed public opinion with its photos of the battered young middle-class man killed by police",
  " She said a lot of people administered the Khaled page",
  " Her group of activists thought about 200 people would show up in Tahrir Square on January 25, but by around 3:00 PM they heard the ground shaking and were shocked when 80,000 people came to the square",

  " Shivam was born with just 3 fingers in his right hand and a joined thumb in his left",
  " His legs were completely tampered and he still walks on his knees",
  "\u201cWhen I was born, everyone suggested my parents to kill me immediately",
  " People would come from far off places just to see me and would pity my parents",
  " Shivam was staying in a small ancestral house with a joint family of 16 members in Mahidpur, Madhya Pradesh",
  " His father was working at a pan-shop on a salary of Rs",
  " 100 per month",
  " With his limited earnings and very little savings, he took Shivam to every possible doctor but there was no cure to the disease",
  " Though Shivam could not do physical activities like other kids did, he was a very quick learner and was highly determined in whatever he would do",
  "Shivam could read books when he was in nursery, hence his teachers promoted me to class 1, right after nursery",
  " But there were speculations made by people that there\u2019s no use of his education as he will never be able to write with just two fingers",
  " But his mother took it on her to teach him to write",
  "\u201cMy mother is the most loving person you will ever meet but she was hell strict with my studies",
  " Maine belan, chappal, chimta sab ki maar khayi hai tab jaake likhna seekha,\u201d he laughs",
  "It was his mother\u2019s persistence that made him so well worse in writing that he have received many awards for best handwriting in his school days",
  "\u00a0\u201cI was the first one in my school to learn and write in cursive, which was kind of an achievement for a kid in hindi medium",
  " That\u2019s when my father realised that only education can make me self dependent and he had not left any stone unturned to do that",
  " Imagine a person having no education, no money and a disabled child, aspiring so big",
  " He was a true hero in that sense,\u201d says Shivam",
  "Though Shivam was loved by most of his teachers, because of his extraordinary intelligence, he would often come crying from the school as other kids would make fun of him or tease him for his condition",
  "Moreover as the school had no facility for the disabled, Shivam had to face lot of difficulties",
  "\u201cThere was only one washroom, which used to be dirty and wet all the time",
  " We didn\u2019t even know about knee- caps those days and so I would have to walk bare knee",
  " To avoid this I would control for 6 hours straight and would use the washroom only when I came back home,\u201d he explains",
  "While Shivam had his own struggles, his father was battling another one",
  " He had been in debt since Shivam\u2019s birth and was not able to repay that yet",
  " So once for all he decided to stop working in the pan shop he was working in since 25 years and opened his own pan shop",
  " This was again a big risk as he had to take another loan to open his own shop",

  " I\u2019ve had a sensory memory of this NDE since I was old enough to know what a memory was",
  " At birth, I went to a group of spiritual beings",
  " I recognized them at once and loved them with every fiber of my being",
  " They asked me if I wanted to live this life",
  " I told them that things were more challenging than I expected, and I didn\u2019t know if I could complete my life mission",
  " I decided to stay \u201cbecause my family needed me\u201d",
  " And, with that, my new life began",
  "My mother was single and seventeen years old when I came into the world",
  " She tried to hide the identity of my birth father and that left me feeling unwanted and unsafe: trust is the most basic need for an infant and young child",
  " I didn&#8217;t understand how I could have three different records of birth with three different last names",
  " The birth certificate my parents used when I entered school identified my adoptive step-father as my birth father",
  " I remembered the adoption, so I guessed the story they told was not true",
  " The second birth-certificate listed my mother\u2019s maiden name, and a third did not reveal my birth father&#8217;s identity but included his last name",
  " My mother told me the name she&#8217;d listed was false and made up to satisfy her parents",
  " However, the name was authentic and at the writing of this story, I have plans to meet two members of my birth father\u2019s family",
  "The GIFT: I lived with my grandparents for the first four years of my life",
  " They played with me and nurtured me",
  " My uncle was fourteen and acted as if he was my big brother",
  " We lived on a farm with gardens, chickens that kept us in fresh eggs, and an apple orchard that provided the apple butter I loved",
  " A river was the boundary of the farms lower gardens",
  " Some of my cherished memories are of watching the flow of water and wondering about the occasional boaters as they floated by",
  " It brought me such peace, even as a child",
  " Each spring orange lilies would bloom in the low area behind the house",
  " The flowers were densely packed into the narrow ravine and were a spectacular sea of orange every year",
  " We owned a workhorse who lived in the pasture field across the dirt road",
  " His job was to plow the fields and plow out the rows where we planted the seeds",
  " Occasionally, my grandfather would lift me onto his back, and we would walk up the lane to the pasture field",
  " I also had a best friend\u2013a dog that I played with every day",
  " Even though I moved away soon after my mother\u2019s marriage, we returned, and their home was the home of my heart until I left for college",
  " I played there as a child",
  " Helped with the gardens and with canning",
  " I can\u2019t thank my grandparents enough",
  " They were my rock when life got shaky",
  " They were my confidants when life got scary",
  "My stepfather brought chaos into the family, not by design, but by circumstance",
  " He was much older than my mother who had a 9th-grade education",
  " He was college educated",
  " When I met him, he was the regional manager of a chain of discount department stores",
  " Things were not perfect, but I don\u2019t remember the small abuses that occurred, I only know the stories that were told to me later in life",
  " The real abuse began when he resigned from his job, so my mother would not have to move each time the company asked him to open a new store",
  " He hated life without his lifelong friends and the job he loved",
  " But, he adored my mother and stayed with her and tried to weather the storm inside him",
  " During this time, age 6 to 10 or 11, I was strangled to the point of near collapse, knocked across the kitchen floor by a fist to the side of the head, and beaten with a switch by my mother to the point of raw and bleeding wounds",
  " The greatest abuse was the little traps that were set to catch me opening and closing drawers while putting away my father\u2019s clean laundry",
  " His drawers were obsessively organized",
  " If anything was moved the tiniest bit, the earth stopped spinning and my world went dark",
  "The GIFT: My stepfather brought with him many gifts",
  " It took me years to realize how much he had given me directly and indirectly",
  " Without him, I would not have become the first person in my mother\u2019s family to achieve a college education",
  " He gave me aunts and uncles who were role models and a cousin who was the maid of honor at my wedding",
  " The best gift of all was my great uncle whom I adored",
  " His gentleness and understanding warmed my heart",
  " He saw me for who I was, and I treasured my time with him",
  " I felt important and worthy",
  " Without this man, I might have remained that timid, fearful, unworthy little girl",
  " With him, I felt enough worth to keep trying",
  "The never-ending fear was one of the hardest things to overcome",
  " My body became used to a hyper-alert state and after a while, it became the norm",
  " One of the thing I feared the most was the horrible, hideous nightmares",
  " So real",
  " So terrifying",
  " Those nightmares ended up being a key to my biological heritage, but at the time they were numbing",
  " Somehow, in the spirit of youth, I was able to get up every morning and go to school",
  " I went through the motions trying to pretend to be a normal young girl",
  " I graduated high school",
  " Had friends",
  " Went to college",
  " But, my soul was scarred and sad",
  " My emotions were strong and debilitating at times",
  "The GIFT: I was intuitive",
  " My family learned this secret when I was about 10 years old",
  " It was Christmas Eve, and like most kids, I wanted to open a gift",
  " My grandmother finally said yes on the condition I could tell her what was inside the package she handed me",
  " I held the package \u2013 looked at her and said, \u201cThere is a green book inside\u201d",
  " The room went silent, and I opened the package to find a green photo album book",
  " I still have it",
  " My intuition opened other doors",
  " One of them was a window into the afterlife",
  " Each time a family member died, I knew it immediately",
  " Sometimes I sensed their presence as they came to say goodbye",
  " I was about 13 or 14 when my uncle came to me after his sudden death \u2013 every night for weeks",
  " He wanted me to help him get home to his wife and children, but I did not know how to help him",
  " He was dead",
  " Now I do know how to help him get to his spiritual home, and I did",
  " One of the greatest gifts was my ability to channel piano music",
  " I knew the music was a spiritual gift to ease my stress",
  " I was not a pianist, but a young girl with only a year of training, Yet, I\u2019d sit for hours, playing one melody after another, getting lost in the sounds",
  "There were other GIFTS in my life",
  " My ninth-grade civics teacher who taught me responsibility and worth",
  " The minister of the neighborhood church and his family who took me into their home for a few months",
  " Special friends from my youth group at church",
  " A friend who knew my story",
  " My high school buddies",
  " A psychology professor at my college who became my mentor and friend",
  " The women at Adult Children of Alcoholics who understood and helped me begin a spiritual recovery journey",

  " All those moments create a foundation that is solid and stable",

  "Hey guys, I\u2019m Shanessa, and I\u2019m just here to tell you a bit about my life experience",
  " For me, living has always been a struggle, my journey with mental illness began when I was 10 years old",
  " Anxiety, depression, OCD",
  " I had no idea what any of those were when I first started to feel them",
  " I thought it was a normal thing to cry yourself to sleep every night, and have no friends in school because you\u2019re literally scared of other people and what they\u2019ll think of you",

  "I hid my mental illness from everyone around me until I was fifteen years old",
  " Fifteen",
  " Five years",
  " I spent the years that were supposed to be fun and happy, in a constant state of sadness and anxiety",
  " I wanted to die",
  " By fifteen years old I was done with life, I convinced myself that there was no happiness to be found for me in this world",

  " Addiction is something that ruins people",
  " I\u2019ve been an addict for three years now, and it almost killed me",
  " Twice",
  " And that, my friends, is how I ended up in a treatment center",
  " That\u2019s getting slightly ahead of myself though, let\u2019s talk about the past a bit longer",
  " So struggling with depression, anxiety, and OCD led me to a life fueled by the want for more drugs",
  " Anything to get my mind to slow down and shut up",
  " The worst thing about having OCD is that you obsess over things; I always freaked out about things that I COULD have done",
  " \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I react this way instead",
  "\u201d \u201cI should\u2019ve said that instead",
  "\u201d Constantly beating myself up for things that I could no longer change",

  " Honestly, if you\u2019re sad and have no hope and your life has been shitty and you don\u2019t even know what to do anymore because mental illness is ruining your life, you should probably consider some intense treatment",
  " Your life didn\u2019t get all fucked up in one day, and you CANNOT BY ANY MEANS get better in one day",
  " It took me almost THIRTEEN MONTHS to get to the point where I am now",
  " Happy",

  "Okay, a bit more backstory because it took a lot more than that to get to the point I\u2019m at now",
  " By the time that I was seventeen years old I was an insecure girl who got high to deal with my mental health problems",
  " I was skipping my classes, and the ones I did attend I wasn\u2019t sober for",
  " I remember math class in particular, I\u2019d go to it while I was tripping balls and take notes, and when I\u2019d go to read the notes the next day, I couldn\u2019t understand them",
  " It was almost as though I had written them in a different language",
  " Scared the shit out of me",
  " What was supposed to be the best years of my life were an absolute living hell",
  " At this point all my diagnoses were ruling my life; drug usage, cutting, drinking, picking off my skin(dermatillomania)",
  " I just couldn\u2019t hack it anymore",
  " It was November of 2016, my first overdose",
  " I\u2019d swallowed a whole bottle of pills, woken up at midnight, and had thrown up for a solid three hours",
  " My liver was failing",
  " One of the worst times in my life was the four hour ambulance ride to get me to a hospital in a bigger city",
  " All by myself, wondering if I would even make it, if I\u2019d ever see my family or friends again, thinking \u201cthis is it, this is how I\u2019m gonna die",
  "\u201d But I didn\u2019t die, I survived and went back to school after a few weeks",
  " My second overdose was in December 2016, I took like 27 tablets, had a seizure in school and got taken to the hospital",
  " That was my last time being inside that school",
  " After it all, my mum gave me the option of going to a treatment center in Utah",
  " I couldn\u2019t live the way I had been anymore, so I agreed",
  " IT SAVED MY LIFE",
  " I can tell you with 100% certainty that had I not gone to treatment I would be dead right now",
  " But its not like I just went there and got better all of a sudden, because that\u2019s not how things work, unfortunately",
  " I made the decision to get better, and worked my ass off to get there",
  "That\u2019s about it",
  " I guess I just want to share my story with others",
  " Inspire hope",
  " Cause when I was in that deep, dark hole of depression I didn\u2019t have any hope",
  " So moral of the story: don\u2019t give up",
  " There\u2019s so much happiness to be found in life, so much to discover and create, and you deserve it all",

  " The next day, I was arrested and charged with the criminal offence of apostasy in accordance with article 126 of the 1991 Penal Code",
  " Article 126 criminalizes the act of abandoning or renouncing Islam on the part of any Sudanese citizen who grew up as Muslim",
  " According to Article 126, apostasy is a crime punishable by death &#8212; once an apostate is convicted, his or her sentence can only be overturned if he or she disowns his or her apostasy and re-embraces Islam",
  "My case, which was unprecedented, received widespread attention in Sudanese (and non-Sudanese) social media networks and electronic newspapers",
  " The authorities found themselves in an embarrassing and delicate situation and their response was a most sinister move",
  " While under arrest, they sent me a psychiatrist who conducted a routine interview at the end of which he gave me the impression of being understanding and sympathetic and cryptically told me, \u201cI\u2019ll help you to get out of this mess",
  "\u201d Soon afterwards, I was told that I was free to go",
  " It was only after my release that I learnt that the psychiatrist submitted a report in which he claimed that I was mentally unbalanced",

  " The authorities adamantly refused to hand a copy of the psychiatrist\u2019s report to my defence lawyers",
  "Following my release, the situation became critical by the day and was increasingly tense and fraught with danger",
  " The Islamist regime could move any day to take its revenge and make an example of me by placing me in a mental institution or, equally likely, one of the many terrorist organizations in the country could take the law into its hands and carry out a \u201cmeritorious\u201d act of jihad against me, since \u201capostates\u201d have no right to life in the eyes of such organizations",
  " It was clear that my unprecedented act had earned me the unique status of a publicly confirmed, \u201cscarlet letter\u201d bearing \u201capostate\u201d whose sanity or life could be snuffed out any moment with impunity",
  " Fearing for my life, I had to leave my country with immense grief and sadness",
  "Finding myself in Kampala does not put an end to my fear",
  " I, as someone who had publicly renounced Islam and whose face has been splashed all over mass media networks, still live in the shadow of the Islamic threat",
  " The Sudanese and Ugandan regimes enjoy close relations and the Sudanese embassy is active in monitoring Sudanese (in particular Darfurian) opposition groups and dissidents",
  " From my first days in Kampala, I was advised to keep a low profile, particularly because of the sensitivity of my case even for the Ugandan authorities which understand and protect my right to abandon Islam in favour of converting to another religion (such as Christianity) but not in favour of rejecting religion altogether ",
  "News from Sudan as far as I am concerned is not good either",
  "\u00a0In February 2018 the Sudanese Constitutional Court dismissed my constitutional challenge against Article 126 of the 1991 Penal Code (the apostasy article) which I had initiated before I had to leave my country,\u00a0and which was followed up by a team of human rights lawyers",
  "\u00a0My\u00a0constitutional challenge of Article 126 was the first of its kind and the\u00a0Constitutional\u00a0Court\u2019s decision came as no surprise\u00a0to me or to the human rights community",

  "Dedication: All victims of domestic violence by alcohol or drug abusers",

  " Patriarchy reigned supreme",
  "Some clarity came of my internal damages to me as an adult working as a secretary as I typed out papers for my boss\u2019 thesis on Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the Holocaust and the Gulag",
  " The more I typed, the more I felt I was typing my own parallel emotional experiences",
  " It was difficult and unnerving",
  " I felt a full fled traumatic body reaction",
  " I even told my boss that I more and more I felt like I have been through a war",
  " And that I too perhaps had PTSD",
  " She didn&#8217;t take me seriously",
  " That was in approximately 1984",
  " PTSD was only becoming a diagnosis for war veterans",

  " COMPLEX &#8211; Post Traumatic Stress Disorder",
  " Worse than PTSD in that it is considered to be a chronic trauma that continues or repeats for months or years at a time",
  " Reading about it, of course I&#8217;ve come to realize that there are many, many who have had it much worse than I, like those who have suffered at the hands of sexual abusers, hostage takers, torturers, war criminals and the like, but I most certainly do fit in a surprising number of the criteria listed in tables of experiences that qualify a person to be identified with C-PTSD",

  " My instincts helped me survive and get further and further away from situations that were traumatic for me",
  "I did my best to recognize and remove myself from the source of trauma and abuse by leaving home at 16 (but my older brother and an even older cousin thought it was such a good idea they came along with my friend and me &#8211; first big red flag that even moving five hours away couldn&#8217;t fix &#8211; they were both alcoholics)I acknowledged the problem at a very early age \u2026 i even encouraged my mother to leave my father at age 5 realizing even then it was undeserved (she responded with her marriage vows, getting worse not better and said what could i know",

  " Still though, without the recognition of the underlying problems all along, therapy did nothing to address it and many therapist considered it simply marital issues",
  " Many therapists simply told me they could not help me",
  " Even recently",
  "I acknowledged the medical diagnosis of chronic unipolar depression and sought medication that worked for me",
  "but the crises never stopped &#8211; a doctor showed me a list of stresses that if one was dealing with three or so at any one given time, there were concerns for health issues &#8211; looking at the list i laughed to myself seeing that I had been dealing with three, four, five or more at any given time in my life up to that point \u2026 and beyond, actually \u2026 much beyondAs you probably know, crises and stressors can be good and bad \u2026 both are hard on a person",

  "**Marriage",
  "***Buying a home",
  "**Having a child (two that have only come to be reasonably nice to me in adulthood and the first was a distressing birth that became critical to one or the other of us\u2019s survival near the end &#8211; a traumatic experience)",

  "*Making presentations in front of colleagues or clients (i discovered at the beginning of a presentation I had the fear of public speaking and did a terrible job of it and thinking of the experience even years later reduced me to tears it was so traumatic)",
  "Unproductive and time-consuming meetings",
  "*Commuting and travel schedules (second husband took a job 300 miles away against my wishes and advice &#8211; those were disastrous and trying times)",
  "Now, again I suspect my body is still responding to having been under such constant stress and through so many crises (I didn\u2019t even touch upon the most recent, my older brother\u2019s aborted attempt of suicide bringing himself to my doorstep to live with me and needing me to help him through his crisis which included dehoarding his house which I said I was happy (in a sad way) to help him with it because he was alive",

  " So, I am not living normally, but trying to in some ways and trying to escape in others",
  " I am avoiding life",
  "Being retired I do not have to get up so often so I just don&#8217;t",

  "One thing I have done that has kept me sane and maybe even alive is that I joined a seniors group that plays a game of cards I enjoyed in my youth and they are a large and friendly group",
  " So three afternoons a week, now reduced to two because I cannot be around people as much as I\u2019d hoped to, I have found some fun in my life",

  " The big difference",
  "Thank you to those that read it to the end",
  " And to all C-PTSD sufferers out there, I wish you strength to deal with it",
  " Perhaps with my surviving rather than succumbing, my story will inspire some to persevere and learn how to be good kind and loving to themselves as they deal with their issues, crises, and stresses &#8211; and to seek help if necessary",
  " Actually I encourage you to share your stories and talk to your health care providers",

  "Girls on the Run is a great program for all girls",
  " The lessons are fantastic and have taught me a lot",
  " My favorite lesson is Star Power and how you imagine and create your star",
  " It shows you that there is more inside what to look for and to deal with different situations",
  " There is a star inside of you",
  " You might have to look very, very closely, but it is always there",
  " Some people don&#8217;t look inside, but on the outside",
  " They won&#8217;t see you they only will see clothes, skin and your face",
  " Your star is beneath all of your skin, clothes and face",
  " Show the inner you",
  " When you look at someone, what do you look for",
  " We all ask ourselves that all the time",
  " We should look for their star",
  " The star power lesson teaches girls just like me, how to do that",
  " I want all girls to do, just that and GOTR is teaching people to do that",
  " GOTR also teaches us to deal with different situations of discouragement and bulling",
  " When you are discouraged your star is covered by a cloud",
  " We learn to blow those clouds with a &#8220;Brthee&#8221; Breather",
  " We can be bullied and have our star covered up, but we will stay strong",

  " Sometimes our phone had a lock on it &#8211; that\u2019s because me and my sister talked on it for too long and ran up a huge bill",
  " We had to literally ask the bill payers permission before we used the phone",
  "We didn\u2019t have a computer or a mobile phone and the internet hadn\u2019t been invented yet",
  " We kept up to date with the world by watching the news on TV and by reading newspapers",
  " Newspapers were exciting things and we had to wait our turn to read them",

  " The best stories were often read out by my dad, with the opening line \u2018Wait till you hear this\u2019",

  " He explained that our house was on fire and that I should prepare myself as my mum and dad\u2019s injuries were severe",
  " He told me that our priest, Father Mac, was on his way to collect me then he and I would pick up my sister from school and go straight to the hospital",
  "Father Mac duly arrived and hurried me out of the building, bundling me into his car",
  " Father Mac didn\u2019t know much more about what had happened just that the explosion had been caused by the new gas heating being installed in our house",
  " He also said that our house was still on fire and that the fire was proving difficult to put out",
  "We picked up my sister from my old school",
  " By this time we were both in a state of panic, confusion and deep concern",
  " We were both crying as we clung to each other",
  " We knew only too well that in our church, sending for a priest is never a good sign",
  "At the hospital, we were ushered to a room by a kind doctor who explained to the three of us (my brother had arrived too) that mum and dad had sustained severe burns all over their bodies from the fire and that they were both seriously ill",
  " Their injuries were so bad that they would have to be taken by ambulance to a bigger hospital about 50 miles away which had specialists equipment and doctors",
  " He further explained that this would be the best place for mum and dad to be treated",
  " For now though, they had to be made comfortable enough to travel",
  "We weren\u2019t allowed to see them as the burns to their skin were so bad and they were still being treated",
  " Also the nurse explained it really would be too upsetting for us as they were in terrible pain",
  " The three of us just sat in a stunned silence, not knowing what to do, what to say or what to think",
  "After an age, the doctor came to tell us that the ambulance was ready to take our parents to the other hospital",
  " We saw them both only very briefly as they were wheeled into the ambulance",
  " They were completely covered in bandages like mummies from some silly black and white movie",
  " The ambulance doors were shut and off it drove into the darkness with the blue light flashing",
  " I was handed a bag which contained the clothes they had been wearing along with my dad\u2019s glasses and his wallet",
  " The three of us were left standing alone, afraid and worried on the edge of the pavement",
  "We had no idea what we were going to do next",
  " Father Mac said we couldn\u2019t go back to our house because it was unsafe and was still on fire",
  " Later we\u2019d come to learn that our house had to be demolished as it was in danger of collapse",
  "Unbeknown to us, the good people that we knew had all heard the awful news and come up with a plan",
  " We were to stay with a family friend for now",
  " We were taken to the nearby house, comforted and given food and drinks",
  " I\u2019ve since realised that people like to feed others in times of crisis",
  " I think it\u2019s some sort of safety valve",
  "I have no doubt we talked for hours as the information started to filter through to us",
  " It was only then that we realised that the only possessions we literally had were the clothes we were wearing and our school bags",
  " Everything else that we owned had been in our house",
  " And that meant all our things had been destroyed",
  " All our books",
  " All our school and college work",
  " All our posters",
  " All our records",
  " All our clothes",

  " All the little things that had made up the place we called home",
  " All gone",
  " Everything",
  " Gone",
  " In just an afternoon",
  " I can\u2019t describe how utterly hopeless things felt right then",
  " We literally had nothing",
  " Apart from each other",
  "We were scared, worried and afraid of our future without our parents",
  " None of us wanted to say the thing we were all thinking &#8211; what if our patents die",
  " What would become of us",
  " We were too young to look after ourselves",
  " Sure we could do adult things but we really weren\u2019t grown up enough to cope with being on our own",
  " Luckily we had lots people to support and to help us",
  "My brother called the doctor at the hospital on a borrowed phone (definately on a table in a hallway) and was told that our parents had arrived safely at the bigger hospital and that the next 48 hours would be critical",
  " We knew that that meant that our parents might die",
  "I have no idea how we slept that night",
  " The next morning, my uncle was coming on the train from his home to take me to the bank",
  " He said we had to discuss the future",
  " He told me that we had to put my dad\u2019s affairs in order",
  " I didn\u2019t know what that meant but I knew it was serious",
  "We went to the bank where I was given cash and a bank card (quite a thing in the 80s)",
  " My uncle said that I had to look after the day to day money",
  " I had also to look after my sister and my brother",
  " My uncle was going to take care of the difficult things like bills and such while I had to make sure my sister and brother had everything they needed",
  "We had to buy some clothes for everyone",
  " This just made me cry",
  " I didn\u2019t care about clothes",
  " I didn\u2019t want to be in charge of day to day money",
  " All I wanted was for my mum and dad to be here with us and to be doing normal things with them",
  " I didn\u2019t want to talk about the future",
  " I certainly didn\u2019t want to think of a future without my parents",
  "Our house had to be demolished for the safety of the neighbourhood",
  " I didn\u2019t go to see the rubble as I thought it would be too distressing",
  " Not many of our possessions were retrieved &#8211; a few photos, a dancing Russian doll ornament, my favourite old stuffed mouse",
  " So many irreplaceable things were lost such as my sister\u2019s favourite teddy, my mum\u2019s sewing machine and a lifetime of knitting patterns",
  " Most of our family photographs were lost although we we did manage to create a lovely album put together with photos from many family and friends",
  "My mum and Dad remained in hospital for about 4 months both having sustained substantial burns",
  " It is remarkable that they both survived",
  " The doctor at the time of admission said he thought it was highly unlikely that either of them would survive the first night",
  "My dads burns were mostly on his hands as he had bravely tried to put out the flames on my mum\u2019s back",
  " Both of them had extensive skin grafts which were incredibly painful, slow to heal and had limited success",
  " My dad had about 30 operators on his hand including having one finger removed before he finally decided that he had had enough treatment",
  "My mum and dad never worked again after their accident",
  " This was a huge blow to my dad especially as he had a professional career and was only in his early 50s at the time of his accident",
  " At times during the preceding years, my dad suffered from bouts of severe depression which was incredibly hard to life with for all of us",
  " As this was the 80s, depression was not a term widely used or understood especially with regards to men",
  " I doubt my dad would have agreed to treatment even if it had been suggested to him",
  " I know both of my parents had nightmares and most probably suffered from PTSD",
  " That said, both lived a long, happy and fulfilled life right up to a ripe old age",
  " Mum grew many gardens and continued to make stunning pieces of clothing including wedding gowns and many knitted hats for her grandchildren",
  " Dad was involved with many projects over the years and continued to be a dedicated charity worker",
  " Mostly though, they enjoyed spending time with their family and watching us all grow as our lives unfolded",
  "The accident was due to an old gas pipe being unsafely disconnected during the installation of the new central heating",

  "Dedication: Those Kids and Adults With DisabilitiesBeing dyslexic was a struggle for me growing up as a kid but I got through it by going to a school for kids with special needs, taking speech therapy classes, and learning different techniques in which helped me learn",
  " Living in a home with brothers that were very mean to me I was always told what I couldn\u2019t do instead of them trying to help me and make things better for me they just made me feel more like I was handicap",
  " I always felt as if I was \u201cdumb\u201d a word that I no longer use in my vocabulary",
  " All these experiences made me into who I am today",
  "At the age of 5 years old I started going to a special school for kids with special needs called People of Appraisal",
  " In the beginning, it helped because it got me out of the house, I was around other kids that were in a similar position as I was, and it helped me with my communication skills with others",
  " This school was supposed to help but it started to make me feel like I couldn\u2019t learn",
  " Most of the kids in the school couldn\u2019t walk, talk, or even feed themselves",
  " I can remember thinking to myself that I wasn\u2019t like the other kids",
  " I began to work very hard to be able to get placed in a normal school",
  " After going to this school for two years I was tested and I scored on a reading and writing level of a 1st-grade student and I was then placed in the 1st grade",
  "At the age of 7, I was placed in the 1st grade at Creswell Elementary in Opelousas Louisiana where I began speech therapy to help me with my reading and writing",
  " That very same year I became an exceptional student and my life began to change for the better",
  " At the end of the year I received so many awards I appeared on the news for my accomplishments",
  " This class not only helped me with my reading and writing but also helped me with my interactions with others",
  " This was only the beginning of a very long struggle with dyslexia",
  " I continued taking the speech therapy classes up until the 7th grade",
  " After the speech classed ended I had to learn without the guidance of my speech therapy teacher which became a struggle for me",
  "My middle school years were hard but I managed to get through them by barely passing",
  " There I am again struggling and I started to believe all that I was told in the past like I couldn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t, and I shouldn\u2019t",
  " Being without guidance I began to struggle with all kinds of issues",
  " I felt as if I wasn\u2019t good enough and then came to that word again \u201cdummy\u201d in which I thought I would never feel or hear again",
  " I was forced by the school to get back on the right path again because I was told that I would be placed in a special class for kids with special needs which we called \u201cSpecial Ed\u201d",
  " This was somewhere I didn&#8217;t want to be so I began to take learning classes after school to help me with my class assignments, my reading, and writing",
  " From then on I begin to have faith in myself again and my grades and attitude began to change",
  " From then on I never let my disabilities define who I am",
  "Now here I am a 37-year-old college freshman and an honor student",
  " Now I do believe in myself and I know that I will succeed in anything I do if I at least try",
  " I&#8217;ve learned that patience goes a long way",
  " Today I&#8217;m not afraid to ask questions if I don\u2019t understand and that doesn\u2019t mean I&#8217;m dumb it means that I do have a disability and I may need to get a little bit more information than others to understand",
  " Yet I still don\u2019t allow any of my disabilities to define who I am and what I&#8217;m capable of",
  "The moral of my story is to never lose faith in yourself or let anyone put you in a box and tell you what you a capable of",
  " You will never know what you are capable of if you don\u2019t try",
  " I never see anything in my life as a failure I see them as learning experiences to better myself",

  " I got home that day and attempted committing suicide",
  " I drank poison but lucky for me, my friends came around and saw me rolling on the ground and they quickly rushed me to the hospital",
  " I would have been dead now",
  "So, I continued life until last year that I finally had a breakthrough",
  " I heard about another job interview that I was not qualified for again, applied for it still and went for it",

  " For me, posting these is actually very difficult",
  " I&#8217;ve never been one to take progress pictures because when I first embarked on this journey I didn&#8217;t even realize what this would become",

  " Having been overweight, and then obese, then losing weight only to gain back even more, for most of my life; I made a decision in 2009, the year I was turning 40, to be a healthier, fit, and happier version of myself than I ever had been before",
  " I had a specific &#8220;size&#8221; that I wanted to be when I turned 40",
  " Not realizing then, that &#8220;size and scale&#8221; were really irrelevant, it was so much more than just being about my body and weight",
  " It was about health, self love, strength&#8230;mind, body, and spirit",
  " I knew it would be difficult, but I was ready to change my life, and I made a promise to myself that I WOULD NOT GIVE UP, no matter how hard it was",
  " I made this decision alone and I&#8217;ve traveled this journey alone for the last 9 years",

  " There was a group of us, at the job I was working at in 2009, that joined Weight Watchers at work which definitely got me started in my food choices and helped me be accountable for the first 60 days of this journey",
  " After that, it was Just me, Google, YouTube, and a shitload of drive and determination",
  " Being overweight was what I was used to, it&#8217;s what I knew, and it was the skin I had been in for the majority of my life",

  " While I did have some supportive people in my life, I had NO IDEA how to handle all of the negativity that I was facing&#8230;",
  "it was completely new terrain for me and, believe it or not, it brought me so many more insecurities than being overweight ever did",
  " It beat me down so low that, emotionally, I found myself in a really difficult place and wasn&#8217;t quite sure how I was going to come out of it",
  " I didn&#8217;t want to let myself down, yet again, so I just continued on with the promise I had made to myself and it was one of THE HARDEST things I have ever done in my life",
  " It&#8217;s only been within the last 2 years that I have FINALLY learned to accept myself, love myself, felt comfortable and confident enough with myself to join a gym, and realize that whatever anyone thinks of me doesn&#8217;t even matter because it&#8217;s MY journey",

  "This is the first time I\u2019ve ever written my story down in words, so here goes nothing",

  " When I was little, life was normal",
  " I had a normal family, went to a normal school, and lived in a normal suburb in a normal city",
  " Everything was great",
  " Until my mother\u2019s father died",
  " At the time, I didn\u2019t know much about my mother, but I learned a lot about her after that",
  " She had dealt with drug and alcohol additiction since she was a teenager, she was clinically depressed and bipolar, and she wasn\u2019t really the relationship type (many, many marriages)",
  " None of these things seemed to matter for the first 6 odd years of my life, but when her father died, she went off her meds, started drinking more and more, divorced my father, and became the monster I now identify as my mother",
  " She blamed me for his cancer (I\u2019m still not sure how that made sense in her head) and became physically and mentally abusive",
  " After years of pain and confusion, I decided that she was right about me and my worthlessness",
  " My 12-year-old self started cutting my ankles with a pocket tool that I found in my backyard, I stopped eating, and I started drinking",
  " Long story short, a teacher noticed a scar on my forehead from being pushed down onto my driveway and reported me to child services",
  " I was pulled out of school and interviewed, and a few weeks later, three days before Christmas, my dad was finally given full custody",
  " Although that was the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me, it wasn\u2019t the end of my problems",
  " My anxiety was making me physically ill, I was drinking insane amounts of liquor whenever I could, and I was hiding these crazy waves of emotions I felt from everyone around me",
  " I reached another low point in my life the summer before my junior year, when I was sexually assaulted by the kicker on our varsity football team",
  " He hosted a house party that night, so two friends and I decided to be \u201ccool\u201d and go",
  " I had too much to drink and ended up passing out on his couch",
  " He carried me to his room, and the rest is history",
  " News spread around the school like wildfire, so I tried to stop the whole drinking thing",
  " It didn\u2019t work",
  " I started using hydrocortisone with a few friends every weekend and drinking all of the time",
  " I barely ate anything, and I quit the sports I used to love",
  " I craved a mother, but never got one",
  " Life seemed fun and exciting from the outside, but I was struggling more than anyone knew",
  " This year I\u2019m a senior in high school",
  " So much has changed",
  " I had always really enjoyed music from a particular artist named Demi Lovato, but it wasn\u2019t until this year that I really started listening and understanding her music and the intentions behind it",
  " Because of her, I\u2019m now receiving mental health treatment and am happier than I\u2019ve ever been in my life",
  " Although I\u2019ve never opened up about my eating disorder or alcohol abuse, I\u2019m working personally to fix what I\u2019ve broken in myself",
  " I\u2019ve been trying incredibly hard to stop calorie counting, I\u2019ve stopped purging, and I\u2019m working to stop drinking",
  " I\u2019m only a week sober, but it\u2019s a step",
  " I\u2019m trying to be honest with those around me, even if that\u2019s really scary",
  " I know I have a role model who overcame much more than what I\u2019ve dealt with, so that gives me hope to recover too",
  " I\u2019m sorry that this is really just me rambling and complaining about some little things that have happened, but I just felt the need to share my progress with someone",

  " As soon as the teacher told students to get up and wish Good Afternoon, that time some students whistled at her",
  " It is not only just a whistle but also a Cat-calling/Wolf-whistling",
  " As the Practical Session of SST (Software Simulation Technique) for B3 Batch Students was off, therefore, they were having Entrepreneurship practical",
  " I feel that the teacher had been a victim of Eve-Teasing",
  " After being whistled by some students of B3 Batch, she just told them that whole B3 Batch will be detained from Entrepreneurship practical",
  " According to me, this is a very less punishment to them, those students who had actually whistled to the teacher should be slapped by her or should be beaten-up by sandals",
  " The most likely reason of why they had whistled to her is that the teacher is very lenient",
  " It is a duty of every citizen of India including students and elders to never ignore such incidents",
  " I am bringing this incident in a knowledge of you-all so that all of you will be alert",
  " For this type of students, their parents should be contacted",

  "",
  "Dedication: Everyone out there struggling who might find strength and hope in my story",
  "Trigger warning: Before reading this post, be aware that it contains descriptions of childhood rape, and other forms of violence and abuse",
  "My story begins somewhere in the early 1990&#8217;s",
  " My mother and father met each other through unknown circumstances, and started dating, living a perfectly happy relationship",
  " In 1994, my mother gave birth to her first child \u2013 a girl named B",
  " My older sister",
  " And in 1996, I followed",
  " This is where the real story begins",
  "Somewhere in 1997, my mother left my father for another man, a man named L",
  " The story is conflicting",
  " My father says she left him because she was unfaithful with L; my mother says she left because my father developed a drinking problem",
  " I never knew who to believe, and to this day, both sides of the story rings of truth, so maybe they were both right",
  " My mother left my father, and took my older sister and I with her",
  "At the start of 1998, my mother and L purchased a farm",
  " It was once a chicken farm, but had since been repurposed as a family home with stables",
  " And then, in 1998, my little sister V was born",
  " And the year after that, in 1999, my mother and L got married",
  " I was 3, so I do not remember any of this",
  "My earliest memory is from the following year, the year 2000",
  " On my 4th birthday, I got a puppy as a birthday present from my grandfather on my mothers side",
  " I called her Bebe",
  " And in 2000, my little brother S was born",
  "My next memory took place in 2002",
  " I was 6 years old at the time, and even though I was so young, I still realized that something had changed",
  " I remember my mother being involved in a car accident",
  " It was dark out when we were taken to the scene by my stepfather",
  " My mothers car was crumpled in a ditch with a semi-trailer in the opposite ditch",
  " I later on learned that the driver of the semi had turned on his high-beams and fallen asleep behind the wheel, veering into the opposite lane, narrowly missing my mother but sending her car flying into the ditch",
  " And it was just after that that everything at home changed",
  " I remember the first threat from my stepfather, L",
  " I remember the first time I was pushed and shoved around",
  " I remember becoming a household slave, taking on a responsibility no six-year-old should ever have to carry",
  " And the threats and punishment would escalate over the following years",
  " In 2004, at the age of 8, I was caught in a routine that I desperately wanted to break free from",
  " I still remember it clear as day, having to get up before the sun rose to throw wood in the furnace to make sure there was hot water for when my mother and stepfather woke up and took a shower",
  " I remember having to put out the clothes for my siblings to get dressed in and preparing their breakfast",
  " I remember having to help my older sister with her homework and facing the pinches and shoves when I got the answer wrong",
  " I remember having to go to school, becoming an entirely different person because I had been threatened not to tell my teachers or classmates what went on at home",
  " And once I got home, the routine continued",
  " I remember having to do my own homework along with my siblings",
  " I remember having to do the laundry on my own, and the violence that ensued if I didn&#8217;t use the right settings on the machine or the right kind of laundry detergent",
  " I remember having to hang it up on the laundry lines, and the ensuing violence if I did it wrong, often over something as trivial as not color-coding the clamps",
  " I remember having to cook dinner for a family of six, clearing away after dinner, washing the dishes and cleaning before falling into bed, exhausted, late in the evening",
  " And the following morning, the routine would start over again",
  "The same year, 2004, my mother and stepfather purchased horses and ponies that soon became my only solace in a life I despised",
  " Life inside the house was exhausting chores and turmoil and escalating violence, and the only place I found peace was in the stable, with one of them especially; a pony named Fury",
  " He became my best friend, and he taught me how to ride",
  " With him, whether on the ground or on his back, I was free",
  "",
  " utterly and completely",
  "In the summer of 2005, I spent a week with my grandmother and her boyfriend",
  " I don&#8217;t remember much of what passed during this time, other than the delicious dessert she would cook up for me and enjoying a week without threats and violence",
  " And when I returned home, disaster had struck",
  " I remember walking in the door, calling for Bebe like I always did upon returning home from vacation or school, only she did not come flying out to greet me like she usually would",
  " Instead I saw my mother\u2019s face, for once filled with compassion and pity",
  " Bebe had been struck by a hit-and-run driver just outside our house, managing to fight her way into the house before dying in my mother\u2019s arms",
  " They had buried her in the backyard",
  "",
  " and so, the stone overlooking her grave and the collar they had attached to the makeshift cross became my new favorite place",
  " I felt like one of my two solaces in my life was gone",
  " The loss of her nearly broke me apart, having suffered so much and then losing one of the only good memories I had",
  "A couple of weeks after that, one of our horses died",
  " A colt, not even 3 years old",
  " He tried jumping out of the stall, being pulled back by the rope attached to his halter, landing wrong and breaking his neck",
  " I found him lying like this on the ground, his neck stretched down his side with his head twisted",
  " He was foaming blood at the mouth, wheezing for breath",
  " And even though I ran for the knife in the feed room, and cut loose the rope, it was too late",
  " The damage was done, and he died before the vet arrived",
  "It was during this year that my older sister and I finally saw our father again",
  " Our mother would put us on a bus and sending us to spend every other weekend with him",
  "",
  " and oh, how I loved it there",
  " There were no threats, no violence, no endless stream of chores I had to do all on my own",
  " I was under strict orders not to tell him anything of what I had to do at home, so I didn&#8217;t tell him",
  " I was terrified of what would happen if my mother and stepfather found out I did",
  " So I came to love the weekends with my father, the perfect father and parent in my life",
  " I remember early Saturday and Sunday mornings, sitting together under a blanket on the couch, eating breakfast and watching cartoons",
  " I remember playing board games and card games to no end",
  " I remember him buying me the new clothes I so desperately needed, and him taking me out to experience new things, such as a trip to the swimming pool, and getting a haircut at a salon",
  "Life continued as such into 2005 and through the following months",
  " In the beginning of June that year, barely a month before my 10th birthday, I was home alone with my stepfather while my mother and siblings were in town",
  " I was doing my chores, flitting from room to room in order to escape my stepfather who loomed over me, terrified about the beating I thought was coming because he was dissatisfied with how well I did my chores",
  " But as it turned out, that was not the reason for his looming over me",
  " Right in the middle of the living room, he forced me on the floor, tore apart my clothes and raped me",
  " I remember the agony, and the way his hands were so rough on my skin",
  " I remember his breath stinking of alcohol, and the way he hissed and grunted in effort",
  " And I remember my own screams and pleading that were to no avail",
  " And once he was done, I remember the blood and semen on the inside of my thighs, the agony I felt when I stumbled from the room, and the way he laughed as I fell to my knees twice on my way to the door",
  " I did not know what to do with myself",
  " I felt violated, and knew that whatever he just did to me, it was wrong",
  " It was something to hide, to feel ashamed of",
  " And remembering the words he said meanwhile, that maybe I did deserve it",
  " That maybe I did want it",
  " So I wiped myself clean, stuffed toilet paper in my underwear to staunch the bleeding, and tried not to limp or whimper in pain as I left my room to continue my chores, because if I didn&#8217;t do them, I would get beaten again",
  " And 2 weeks later, in late June, I found a relief for my inner pain",
  "",
  " by causing myself pain on the outside",
  " I discovered, what I then considered, the wonder of cutting and burning yourself",
  " The pain I could handle, because I was used to it",
  " And it was the relief, hurting myself on the outside to silence the thing on the inside, that made me keep doing it",
  " I never did it where my family would see, though",
  " And still, the hell that was my life continued to drop like a stone",
  " I did not celebrate a birthday \u2013 we never did celebrate it",
  " My parents, and my siblings, would be celebrated with early mornings, presents, birthday cakes, freshly baked bread and buns and chocolate milk, but never mine",
  " Just like I was never allowed to leave my room on Christmas, Easter or New Years",
  " Instead I would be given 3 meager meals per day and be let out to use the bathroom two times per day",
  " Because, God forbid, I would ruin the happy holidays by my presence",
  " So, my only solace was my self-harming, and my collection of books I&#8217;d taken from the bookshelf in the living room when no one was looking",
  " Reading equaled escape, entering a whole new world where I would forget about my own",
  "In 2005, 3 of our horses were put down",
  " I never figured out why",
  " Fury was among the 3 that remained alive",
  " And a month after that, I finally broke under the pressure, after one particular episode of bullying at school tearing me down",
  " And I think my stepfather must have known",
  " Because I found my cat with her neck broken on my bed that night",
  " A silent warning to keep my mouth shut about what was going on, but instead it had to opposite effect of what my stepfather intended for it to have",
  " I never told anyone, oh no, but by that time, I was a shell of the girl I should have been, and my teachers started to notice",
  " They started a formal investigation into how life at home was, asking me and my siblings all sorts of questions",
  " I remember the nice lady and all the questions she asked, and I remember lying to her, telling her everything was perfect",
  " Soon after, the investigation ended with nobody being any wiser about how my life really was",
  "And in December, another one of our horses died",
  " I remember being woken up, yelled at to get dressed and get outside to keep the horse on her feet by walking around with her",
  " I remember the Christmas stockings on the wall, and the Christmas calendars",
  " No tree yet, though, so it was early on in the month",
  " And even as I walked around for hours that night with her, she eventually gave up, collapsing and dying in the snow",
  "And on Christmas Day that year, I tried to take my own life for the first time",
  " I was 10 years old",
  " My mother\u2019s solution to the problem I presented when she found me with my wrists slit was to staunch the bleeding and tie me to a chair, so I could not tear off the bandages and continue bleeding",
  " She did not seem surprised",
  " She didn&#8217;t cry or ask me why",
  " If anything, she seemed disappointed and angry, but not with herself or her husband, but at me",
  " Silently asking me \u201cHow dare you do this, you ungrateful child",
  "\u201dAnd a week after this, the day before New Years Eve, an early morning when I went to feed Fury, I found him lying on the floor",
  " He was alive; but he refused to get up",
  " I remember trying to pull him on his feet and shaking a bucket of feed near his face",
  " And when he still would not get up, I realized that he was trying to tell me he was giving up, that his time had come",
  " He had been left alone as all our other horses died or sold, leaving him behind",
  " So I sat down on in the middle of the stall, in the middle of the muck, took his head in my lap, and sang to him while running my hand over his head",
  " And he died in my arms",
  " And suddenly, I was left behind, alone, just like he was",
  "New Years Eve came and went, and 2006 began",
  " By this time, I had stopped hoping for a better year",
  " And in January, one chapter of life ended, and another began",
  " I was at home with my little brother, S, and my stepfather",
  " I remember him drinking and getting angrier by the minute",
  " In an effort to protect my little brother from seeing his father like that, I took him to my room and called my mother",
  " And as my mother came home with my other two siblings, my mother and stepfather had a huge fight",
  " They didn&#8217;t just yell at each other, they fought",
  " They shoved each other into the furniture, throwing around their wedding rings",
  " She had been cheating on him with a man she\u2019d known since elementary school",
  " And as our mother screamed at us to gather our things, put on our jackets, and wait in the kitchen, my older sister got the order to call the police",
  " After doing so, she stepped into the living room with me right behind her and shouted over the yelling that she\u2019d called them and that they were on their way",
  " In a fit of rage, my stepfather went for my older sister, and in her defense, my mother grabbed him by the throat and took him down to the floor, straddling his chest, yelling at us to RUN",
  " So we ran",
  " Four children, aged 12 to 6, running out of our home on a cold and snowy January night",
  " Our mother caught up with us soon after, and together we ran down the street, heading for a safe haven with a friend of my mother, with my stepfather chasing us in his car",
  " Several times underway we hid behind snowbanks, and in the garages and behind houses of strangers along the road, never being discovered by them or my stepfather",
  " And then we reached the safe haven, only to have him show up 15 minutes later, finally having realized where we went",
  " But instead of letting him in, my mother\u2019s friend and her husband told my stepfather that we had not shown up, but that if we would, they would call him immediately",
  " He left in a hurry, his tires kicking up snow as he drove away from the house",
  " The day after, my older sister and I were sent to our fathers\u2019 house while my mother and my two youngest siblings, stepsister and stepbrother, went to a city four hours away with our mother, over to her new boyfriend, the man she was cheating on my stepfather with",
  "And my life changed",
  "",
  " for a time",
  " Out of reach of my mother, in a safe environment with my father, I started trying to cope with the drastic changes that had happened in my life while still keeping all the abuse a secret",
  " My father did not understand how I was so traumatized while my sister was perfectly sane, so perfectly",
  "",
  " normal",
  " And even though my life was better, that there was no abuse, no threats, nothing of what my life had been like up until that point, I still tried to kill myself for the second and third time in a month",
  " Perhaps it was because I finally realized what I had been missing out on, or perhaps because I was just tired of living",
  " Looking back on it now, I can admit it was a good bit of both",
  "Not long after that, my mother moved back to the same city we&#8217;d all left a few months earlier, although a different house, bringing all four of her children with her",
  " And I had hope, that for the first time, life with her would be different now that she was no longer living with my stepfather",
  " I was wrong",
  " The abuse continued, just by her hand instead of both of theirs",
  " And while her boyfriend never laid a hand on me while he was there, he didn&#8217;t hold back on the yelling and the anger",
  " And so, life went on in the same way it always did, daily beatings and daily threats",
  " And over the next 3 years, until 2009, I tried to kill myself the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh time in my life, failing every time either by being interrupted, treated or simply failing depending on the method I used, and still, I was cutting, now more than ever",
  " I started cutting where people could see, a silent cry for help, that instead of getting people to help me, caused my teachers to stick me at the back of class, only intensifying the bullying I suffered every day at school",
  "And in 2010, my mother told us the news",
  " She was pregnant with her fifth child",
  " And in 2010, a little boy was born",
  " R",
  " Life continued, only now I also had the added responsibility of taking care of a newborn babe, something that terrified me beyond words because he was so fragile; and I had no idea what I was doing",
  " And on it went, and the year passed just like all the ones before it did, with daily beatings either because I didn&#8217;t do a chore good enough, or fast enough, or simply because my mother was frustrated over something",
  " I was reduced to nothing more than a slave and a punching bag",
  "In 2011, I finally snapped, something that had been coming on for a long time",
  " I remember having just come home from school, stepping into the kitchen before being told to empty the dishwasher",
  " It wasn&#8217;t a hard chore at all, but it was the memories behind the command, and the general feeling of anger I carried around with me at all times",
  " I told her no, for the first time in years",
  " And as she flew into a fit, yelling at me to do what I was told, I snapped even further",
  " I did not care anymore, entering the stage of lethal calm, the stage past the breaking point",
  " I told her no once again, and as she went to punch me, the roles reversed",
  " I punched her one time, square in the face, and she fell to the floor",
  " This was the first time I lifted a finger towards her or anyone else in my entire life, and I hate to admit it, but it felt good, turning the tables at last",
  " I left her sitting there on the floor, crying and screaming",
  " I packed my bag with the essentials, left the house and got on the next bus out of there",
  " Went to my father\u2019s house, begged him to take me in, and told him everything I had endured all those years",
  " E-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g",
  " Or, almost everything",
  " I never told him about the rape, and to this day, I still haven&#8217;t",
  " Not because I don&#8217;t think he doesn\u2019t deserve to know, but because it won&#8217;t change anything other than how he looks at me",
  "He was appalled and enraged by what I told him",
  " And his heart was breaking",
  " I could see it in his stare, and the way he cried and hugged me to his chest",
  " And for the first time in years, I accepted physical contact",
  " He spent most of the following week on the phone with my mother, usually yelling and screaming into the phone, threatening her with lawsuits and criminal charges the rest of the time",
  " And eventually, they came to an agreement \u2013 I would move in with him, effective immediately",
  " And so I did",
  " And then I cut all contact with my mother",
  " Cut her right out of my life like a surgeon would cut out a tumor",
  "My life changed, but not as much as I wanted it to",
  " I would receive threats via text messages and messages on social media from my mother and her boyfriend along with messages insulting me and my father",
  " My older sister did not understand the hate between all of us because she, like my other siblings, never noticed how I was treated because they were never around when I was abused",
  "And I was traumatized",
  " I might have been in a safer environment, a better one, but in my mind, I could hardly differentiate",
  " The smallest thing would set me off into a fit of fury, or a fit of tears",
  " My father did not know what to do with me, and eventually came to the conclusion that I had to see a doctor",
  " There I was diagnosed with a Depression, Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome, Anxiety, Social Anxiety and Bipolar Disorder I",
  " And this resulted in going through several psychiatrists and a lot of different medication before they found the combination that could help me: a psychiatrist named C, and a bunch of pills",
  "In 2011, I started a new school closer to my dad than the old one I&#8217;d left behind when I moved",
  " I started in the middle of 8th grade and managed to feel okay at school for 2 weeks before the bullying began",
  " By this time, I was very different from my peers",
  " I would sit quietly in class, always with earbuds and music in my ears, and my nose stuck in a book in both class and recess",
  " Having had enough of bullying and the misery of life by that point, I started ditching classes, then skipping school entirely",
  " And a few weeks after that, I finally figured out what my mom always meant when she said my dad was a no-good alcoholic drug-addict",
  " His substance abuse kicked off, and I paid the price for it, becoming a punching bag when the combination of heroin, and whatever other drugs he took, and alcohol made him violent",
  " But I was no longer going to sit idly by and take it \u2013 partly because he was much stronger than my mother and stepfather ever were, and partly because I had grown stronger while growing weaker at the same time",
  " So when he came looking for a fight, I gave him one",
  " I would frequently have to knock him out in order to stop him from assaulting me",
  " And thus came my eighth, ninth, tenth and eleventh suicide attempts",
  " By this time, I could not decide if I was just bad at taking my own life, or if there was someone looking over me, refusing to let me die",
  " And if the latter was the case, I wanted to kill them",
  " I just wanted peace from the hell that was my life",
  " And I especially wanted peace from having to watch my father drink himself into a stupor every single day, waking up drunk, passing out in a pool of his own piss, and having to stop him from licking up the vomit he&#8217;d just expulsed, because according to him, he couldn&#8217;t let the alcohol in it go to waste",
  "In 2011, I started 9th grade at the same school, and the bullying continued as usual",
  " I skipped classes, and frequently entire days of school, doing my homework assignments at home before turning them in on time just to go straight back home",
  " Because of my homework receiving good grades, the school board overlooked my absence",
  "In September 2011, a bit of light entered my life",
  " I met a colleague of my dad, a kind man named B, his wife A and their two children, S and P, two adorable kids aged 6 and 4",
  " They had no idea what was going on in my father\u2019s home, and I never told them because I didn&#8217;t want their pity",
  " S and P, fell in love with me; started calling me \u201cbig sister\u201d",
  " They introduced me to a horse they owned, a beautiful gelding named Sandy, and a black pony named Jake who looked eerily like Fury",
  " They let me ride Jake and take care of him, adding some joy back into my life in shape of the peace I had always found when in the company of horses",
  "And in early December 2011, I had prepared for my twelfth suicide attempt",
  " I got a bottle of water, and a glass of strong sleeping pills",
  " I even wrote a little letter, folded it and placed it on my desk, not that it seemed to matter, because who would even care enough to read it",
  " I had no one that I could turn to",
  " No family, no friends to turn to, and in my desperation for someone to care, anyone, I went online to a public chatroom I&#8217;d frequently watched but rarely participated in when spending some free time playing a game on the site",
  " And there, a user named **** took the minute to send me a private message, asking \u201cAre you alright",
  "\u201dIt changed my life",
  " In my desperation, I told him everything about the hell that was my life, figuring that either he&#8217;d care and I&#8217;d finally have someone who did, or he wouldn&#8217;t and I wouldn&#8217;t be missed anyway",
  "",
  " but he cared",
  " We spent 4 hours chatting privately to each other that night, exchanged phone numbers before logging off, and texted until 5 in the morning",
  " His name was Z, and he saved my life",
  "Through the following months, him and I would e-mail, chat on social media, text via phone, talk via phone calls and voice calls on Skype",
  " He became my online buddy, my only friend, and the person who made me stop and think that, \u201chey, maybe life is worth it",
  "\u201dIn June 2012, my 9th grade exams came up, and I skipped them all",
  " I saw no reason to take them when I was unable to continue on another line of education the year after anyway",
  "And in July 2012, after knowing Z for little over a year, he confessed his love for me",
  "",
  " and thus began our long-distance relationship",
  " He would text me randomly during the day, things such as \u201cHi beautiful, how are you",
  "\u201d and \u201cRemember I love you\u201d",
  " He was a light shining in an otherwise dark world",
  " And his light and love kept the shadows at bay",
  "In 2012, I started 10th grade, a grade meant for students who were not yet ready to move on, but who were also too far along to take another 9th grade",
  " And, like I expected, the bullying started again, only this time it was mixed with sexual assaults of mild degrees",
  " I was still the quiet girl who would rather read at all times than talk to her fellow classmates; which made me a target for bullying",
  " And I had also matured into a beautiful young woman, which tempted the guys into fondling me in the hallways, something that, with my past, did not go over well",
  " And when I&#8217;d lash out, I became known as the girl with the short fuse",
  "",
  " an endless circle",
  " So in January 2013, I dropped out of 10th grade and started working as a part-time stable hand at the same riding school where I rode Jake",
  " It was the best decision I ever made",
  " I started working from 9 to 12, a short 3 hours, but voluntarily took more and more hours until I worked a full day from 6 to 2, or 4 to 10",
  " And even that was not enough",
  "",
  " I loved it",
  " I loved the hard physical work that took my mind off everything",
  " I loved the smell of the horses and the leather tack",
  " I loved exercising them whether from the ground or their backs",
  " I loved brushing them, and I loved teaching younger people to ride",
  " So it doubled as an escape, a way to get away from home and a job I loved",
  " I would eventually meet at 5:30 in the morning, open up everything, work until 10pm at night when I would lock down everything, go home, eat, shower, fall asleep and then repeat",
  " It became a sort of heaven for me",
  "",
  " I knew nothing better",
  " And even with how life was still with my father, I no longer paid it special mind",
  "",
  " my job was my therapy",
  "In December 2013, I picked up a free horse, Spirit",
  " His owner had connections to a drug dealing ring, and was going to prison",
  " I was the best person suitable for taking Spirit in, so she sold him to me for the sum of 1 dollar so a contract could be written",
  "In March 2013, I quit my job",
  " A new part time stable hand had arrived, and messed up the previously pleasant atmosphere",
  " She would insult the paying customers, abuse the horses when she thought no one was watching, insult me and she even attacked me with a pitchfork, narrowly missing puncturing my back with it",
  " My boss, however, overlooked it all",
  "",
  " either because the stable hand was sent there by the government as a part of a rehabilitation program, or because her parents supported the place financially",
  " The last straw was after I got injured exercising a horse as part of my work; my boss threatened me to come into work the day after, despite me having be examined by doctors saying I shouldn&#8217;t be working for at least 3 more weeks",
  " Never one for threats, I told her right then and there that I quit",
  " I&#8217;d had enough",
  "Shortly after that, physical issues with my hips became more obvious, something I&#8217;d noticed over the previous couple of years but never paid much attention to because it wasn&#8217;t bad enough to care about",
  " But now that I was without the regular exercise I had while working, I started being pained by my hips",
  " A visit to the doctors office and resulting X-ray and MRI resulted in a diagnosis of slight Scoliosis with further tests coming at a later date to determine the cause for the issues with my hips",
  "And shortly after that, I started at a new school",
  " It was a school for people from the ages of 16 and up to 25 who could, for whatever reason, not go to a normal school",
  " It wasn&#8217;t a school for mentally challenged or physically handicapped people, but a mix in-between",
  " Everyone there suffered from something that had made them victims at other schools, just like me",
  " And there, I even managed to make a few friends, and because we all had something to deal with, there was no bullying",
  " But life at home became gradually worse; and now I no longer had work to distract me with or use as therapy, and while I had Sassy and loved him, it was not quite the same",
  " Cue my thirteenth suicide attempt",
  " Lucky number 13",
  " Or so I wished",
  " For the first time, I actually regretted doing it right after I&#8217;d taken the overdose of medication",
  " I tried to decide whether or not to call Z to tell him what I&#8217;d done, but he called me instead, at 2am where he, 2 hours previously, had said he was going to bed",
  " And his first words were \u201cThis odd feeling woke me up",
  " What did you do",
  "\u201d",
  " Really made me believe in the divine",
  " He said he&#8217;d felt restless, woken up with a feeling of urgency, and called me",
  " He persuaded me to call an ambulance, and get treated for the OD, resulting in a 2 days hospitalization",
  " And then he made me promise him not to kill myself ever again, or to cut myself ever again; and I promised him",
  " And to this day, I haven&#8217;t broken this promise",
  "In January 2014, I had to sell Spirit",
  " I was moving north, to move in with Z and his family, and could not bring Spirit with me",
  " It broke my heart, but I had no other choice",
  " And so, I said farewell to my best friend",
  "In March 2014, I moved in with Z\u2019s family and tried to adjust to family life, something that was very difficult because I never had it before",
  " And a couple of weeks later, the issue with my hips was finally determined",
  " I had Hip Dysplasia with a 7\u00ba difference between the left and right side, something that doesn&#8217;t sound like much, but still resulted in me walking unevenly, one leg being slightly longer than the other, worsened by my mild degree of Scoliosis",
  " And thus, I started physical therapy which didn&#8217;t help",
  " I then resorted to starting riding at a local riding school in the hopes of it being a pain reliever like riding used to be",
  " And I was right",
  " Z\u2019s mother and father also took me to a psychiatrist, starting a new bout of examinations and finding medication, while not understanding at all, despite them telling my psychiatrist they did",
  " I got medication to take every night, which I did, along with another type of medication, a smaller dose, that was considered \u201cemergency pills\u201d for when I hit rock bottom and needed a pick me up",
  "",
  " problem was just that whenever I needed these, my mother in law refused to let me take them, saying I should just go for a walk instead and then I&#8217;d be OK again",
  " She was incapable of understanding that a walk wouldn\u2019t be a miracle cure",
  "Then I began studying via the internet, taking online courses so I could finally take my 9th grade exams when summer came around",
  " It was also around this time that I began speaking with my older sister again for the first time in a couple of years; she did not believe me those years ago, when I told her how my mother was, but by now, she&#8217;d experienced a tiny bit of the same and had come to see the truth",
  "Then, on Christmas Eve, my first Christmas not locked up in my room, I was pretty shut in and quiet",
  " Z understood it; but his parents did not",
  " And when Z\u2019s older brother and his fianc\u00e9e had left, his mother verbally assaulted me, telling me to stop acting like such a freak and get a grip because what I was doing was completely abnormal",
  " On and on she went for several minutes before I broke down, not understanding what I did wrong and not understanding why she could not understand that a walk and some meds didn&#8217;t magically make my mental diagnoses go away",
  " Z stood up and screamed at her to get out of her room, that it had to stop, that he couldn&#8217;t see why she had to pick on me like that all the time",
  " And to our surprise, she actually left the room",
  " That was the beginning of an awkward relationship between his mother and me, even directly hateful from her side",
  "In May 2016, I started talking to my dad again",
  " He&#8217;d cut down on his drinking and stated at a rehabilitation center to get his drug addiction under control",
  " And I was proud of him for manning up to do it",
  "I graduated from the online course education with fantastic grades, the best of everyone",
  "Not long after, my periods started disappearing while I would experience extreme pains when I would normally have bled",
  " Went to the doctors, was examined but they found nothing, but prescribed me strong painkillers to take if the pains became too much",
  "In the end of June 2016, I got my own apartment, the apartment that I live in now",
  " I celebrated my 21st birthday in an apartment I could call my own, with my own rules, no one deciding what type of knives I was allowed to use out of fear for me cutting myself, or how and when I should take my medication out of fear I might overdose",
  " It was heaven",
  "A few months later, I woke up early one morning in extreme pains",
  " Z called an ambulance, I was taken in and examined, and there they finally gave me a diagnosis: Endometriosis",
  "And not long after that, I started cutting down on my psychiatric medication, no longer needing it to remain happy, or at worst, feeling \u201cok\u201d",
  "And a few months after that, I was hospitalized once again with extreme pains coming from my uterus",
  " After thorough examinations, the doctors discovered a tumor in my uterus that along with my Endometriosis have been the cause for my periods being absent for over a year, the frequent pains that at times become extreme",
  "In December 2016, I responded to my mothers\u2019 attempt to breach the gap between us for the first time since I cut off all contact with her, again, after trying to give her a chance just to have it backfire on me the last two years",
  " She told me she was getting married to the man she&#8217;d left my stepfather for all those years ago",
  " I was genuinely happy for her, but also wary",
  "Then along came 2017, and I was still dealing with pains from my uterus along with extreme bleedings appearing randomly, having dropped out of school because I was unable to keep up with my studies while suffering from pains",
  "And then in April, I bought Carla, my puppy who has been my pride and joy since I first laid eyes on her",
  " Z\u2019s school meant he was gone for most of the day, and I never did do well with being lonely",
  " I&#8217;d either sleep too much, or spend too much time thinking about things, worrying and stressing",
  " So in the middle of March I decided to look online, and stumbled upon a registered breeder about an hour from here",
  " The pictures of parents and the litter were&#8230; beautiful",
  " I fell in love at first glance; I&#8217;d always loved big dogs, and this particular breed specifically",
  " So Z and I went to visit the breeders and see the puppies",
  " Upon arrival, there was 4 puppies out of the litter of 11 left",
  " Three of puppies were tumbling around, playing, while the fourth, the smallest, was sitting quietly, and as I kneeled, she came over, sniffed my hand and planted herself on my feet",
  " Just sat her little butt down right there on my boots",
  " I like to think she chose me that day, in that instant",
  " And in April, 2017, I brought her home",
  "In 2017, my mother got married to O, her boyfriend, and I was a bridesmaid",
  " It was a peculiar situation, being asked to be so especially after the rocky relationship my mother and I had my entire life, but it was worth it",
  " She seems to have changed for real this time around",
  " She seems happier, and I&#8217;m happy for her",
  ", and for the chance that I may finally get to have a relationship with her, as good as it can get, considering the past",
  "I broke up with Z in early in December 2017, after being with him for 5 years",
  " Three months earlier, he started getting distant",
  " He wouldn\u2019t come to see me or spend time with me",
  " He\u2019d lie about being too busy with homework to talk to me, and he\u2019d stream his gameplay after having blocked my main account in an attempt to hide it from me",
  " He\u2019d lie about his headache bothering him too much to come and spend the night so I could enjoy his presence and company, even if it was just to go straight to bed and sleep",
  " I would constantly get harassing messages from his mother, and one of them proved to be the last straw and the push I needed to get out of that relationship",
  " She told me I could go hang myself from a tree and she wouldn\u2019t give a damn",
  " And when I told Z so, all he had to reply was \u201cHuh",
  "\u201d",
  " That\u2019s when I realized that he no longer cared, and that I deserved better",
  " During those three months, I spoke much and often with a close friend named E that I\u2019d known for 6 years, and whom I even had a crush on before I ultimately ended up picking Z instead",
  " E confirmed that I deserved better",
  " He supported me, even came with suggestion as to how I could try saving my relationship before it fell completely apart",
  " On the day I broke up with Z, E came to see me and support me",
  " He was gentle and respectful of the exhausting couple of months I\u2019d had",
  " He talked to me when I needed to let out my emotions, he hugged me when I cried, and he made me happy",
  " And in the start of 2018, we decided to give our relationship a shot",
  " A little early, some might think, and I did think so too, for a while",
  " But then I came to realize that with every lie Z told me, every time he refused to see me, we just drifted further apart \u2013 and I\u2019d actually gotten over him during those three months",
  " And on the day I made it final, I cried once",
  " And I haven\u2019t cried over him since",
  "At the end of January, I moved to the other end of the country, renting a room with E\u2019s father, a good man who\u2019s been a friend of my family for many years",
  " I\u2019m saving up to get my own place again",
  " I like my independence; I crave it",
  " There\u2019s many bonuses to moving here",
  " I\u2019m closer to E, closer to my entire family, closer to school",
  " There\u2019s dog parks for Carla to enjoy, riding schools for me to enjoy, and any store I could ever need is close by",
  "So now, present day, I still suffer from pains on a daily basis from both hip and uterus, but manage them because now they&#8217;re worth it, outweighed by the good stuff that has happened and is going on",
  " I&#8217;ve started a 3-year University line of education with multiple subjects at the start of February, with online classes so I won&#8217;t have to drop out due to physical issues",
  " I\u2019m closer to my mother and father than ever before",
  " I spoke to my little brother for the first time in 8 years at the end of last year; so long, that I had forgotten his voice",
  " I have been without my psychiatric medication for about two years",
  " I still keep it with me, though, for those really bad days",
  " I haven&#8217;t tried to take my own life since the start of 2014, and have been clean from cutting and other kinds of self-harm for just as long",
  " The urge to self-harm is still there, at times, but when I find myself staring longingly at the knife block or try to figure out how many pills it\u2019d take to kill me, I shift my eyes to Carla, and to E, and then the urge disappears",
  " And I know now, that no matter what, I&#8217;m strong enough to get through it, and anything else life throws at me",
  " And I know for sure, that no matter what, I&#8217;ll be okay",
  " Because I wouldn&#8217;t allow it to be any other way",
  "\u201cAnd if you can\u2019t see anything beautiful about yourself, get a better mirror",

  " The next day, Heather asked if I would call her because she wanted to talk to me about something important",

  " Heather stood with us as a bridesmaid on our wedding day",
  " Though we live in Cleveland, Ohio and she lives in Columbus, we see each other as often as possible",
  " Trips to Put-in-Bay, Hocking Hills and Punta Cana continue to nourish our friendships and feed our strong bond",
  "Many people know what surrogacy is, but aren\u2019t familiar with what is truly involved nor the medical terminology",
  " Jarrod and I certainly didn\u2019t before we were thrust into this world",
  " After the rounds of IVF, we had 5 embryos",
  " It wasn\u2019t as many as we would have hoped but we still had options, which made us incredibly grateful",
  " It took several months after my hysterectomy before I really felt that I was back to myself in any way",
  " It was the difficulty of losing my ability to carry children but also the unknown of our future that continued to loom over my head",
  " Heather, Jeremy, Jarrod and I kept our future plans quiet as there were so many unknowns, and the more people that knew, the more we would possibly have to tell if it didn\u2019t all work out",
  " We began the first steps in June, which required Heather to undergo a medical exam by our reproductive endocrinologist\u2019s team to ensure that she could again carry a baby to full-term",
  " During that same visit, we all met with a psychologist to review potential difficult decisions that we may have to face as a foursome in this journey",
  " If the baby is diagnosed with a birth defect, would we terminate the pregnancy",
  " We all agreed that we would not",
  " Jarrod and I would love our child no matter what",
  " Heather and Jeremy had to answer a 500+ Scantron questionnaire to assure that they were also psychologically prepared for their role",
  " We received the green light from the medical team and moved to the next step: legal",
  "Both the intended parents (Jarrod and me) and the carrier (Heather and her husband) needed legal representation in order to essentially draft a contract saying that the child was Jarrod and mine",
  " It felt so cold and read exactly like you\u2019d expect a contract to",
  " It made me even more thankful for my relationship with Heather because we have always been able to speak so candidly with each other",
  " Even before we got this far, we had talked about everything that was covered in the contract: how many embryos would be implanted, what would we do if the baby was diagnosed with a congenital disease and ultimately, what would we do if we weren\u2019t able to get pregnant this way at all",
  " So, while the contract process took a bit of the romance out of this process, the four of us had very open conversations about what we would include",
  " Finally, the contracts were created be our respective attorneys and now we could actually try to get pregnant",
  "People see in the movies the unpleasantness that follows when a woman has to inject hormones into her body to try to get pregnant",
  " I don\u2019t think people realize just how long this goes on",
  " Heather began injections in August to prepare for the transfer at the end of the month",
  " If we got pregnant, she would have to continue to inject herself with a substance that looked like maple syrup every night until the 11th week of pregnancy",
  " That is definitely commitment",
  " The transfer would take place on August 31",
  " She was fully open to having two embryos transferred which would increase the odds of achieving pregnancy, recognizing that twins may be a possibility",
  " Even so, we had about a 45% chance of getting pregnant at all, and twins were a 30% chance separate from that",
  "The day of the transfer, the four of us were nervous, held hands and just tried to be positive and take it all in",
  " We went to lunch afterward, talked about what could be, and just enjoyed the time together",
  " I had purchased a handful of pregnancy tests for Heather but the nurse had said to wait about 10 days before we\u2019d see anything",
  " Sweet, impatient Heather called me about 7 days later and said she couldn\u2019t wait and had gone through all of them",
  " I couldn\u2019t stop from laughing",
  " She had gone in for blood testing and the HCG levels (a hormone which a woman produces when pregnant) were increasing as we would have hoped",
  " Finally, on September 14, the doctor confirmed: we were pregnant",
  "I couldn\u2019t believe it",
  " I was so excited, I wanted to go out and buy everything baby",
  " But, I had to remind myself, we were so early in that I just had to temper that excitement",
  " On September 29, we had an appointment with Heather\u2019s OB/GYN in Columbus to see our first ultrasound",
  " The four of us sat in a small, dark room, watching the monitor, not knowing what we were looking at",
  " The ultrasound technician looked over at us and said, \u201cGuess who has 2 heartbeats",
  "\u201d Heather and I held hands and cried together",
  " The ultrasound technician cried",
  " She told us that she had her two children via surrogate so she is just so happy for us",
  " We began calling them Merle and Pearl, and we were all just ecstatic",
  " Twins",
  " We couldn\u2019t believe it",
  " On the drive home, Jarrod and I started throwing out possible baby names and reveling in the news",
  "We knew we wanted to find out the sex of the babies because we wanted to feel more involved in the pregnancy",
  " It would help me to nest if I was buying girl or boy items",
  " Prior to our early November appointment, we had opted to do a blood draw to determine if there were any congenital issues we should know about",
  " Like our OB/GYN, we agreed that information is power",
  " The test results would be able to tell us if there was a Y chromosome, which would mean there was at least one boy in there",
  " It could be two boys or a boy and a girl",
  " If there wasn\u2019t a Y chromosome, it would be two girls",
  " We found out shortly after that we were having at least one boy",
  " On the drive home, Jarrod said to me, \u201cAre you ready to meet your son",
  "\u201d and I just cried on his shoulder",
  "On December 4, we went in for our 16 week ultrasound and didn\u2019t expect to find out the genders because all the week-by-week pregnancy guides said it\u2019d be more likely around week 20",
  " Again, we are in the small, dark room and the ultrasound technician finds Baby A, which is the boy",
  " She showed us how she could tell it was the boy and we could see his twig and berries",
  " Baby B was being a little more shy but showed us a perfectly shaped skeleton and their cute heartbeat waving on the screen",
  " We had a different ultrasound technician this time, but by now, they all knew our story",
  " The technician freezes the screen, turns to us and says, \u201cSomething looks different on this one",
  "\u201d We were having a girl",
  " Merle and Pearl were confirmed for May 2018",
  "Now we are in our 20th week of pregnancy and the babies are the size of a banana",
  " Jarrod and I are in preparation mode, cleaning out our guest bedrooms to make room for cribs and gliders, signing up for infant care and CPR classes and looking at trading in my zippy little car for a minivan",
  " We have been married for 1 year and 3 months and have already gone through some incredible trials but we are stronger for it",
  " It made us a better couple who is preparing for these sweet babies to enter our lives and we can shower them with love",
  " Heather told our story to a friend of hers who said, \u201cYa know, I don\u2019t believe in God but to hear about your friend getting married, having cancer, beating cancer, then getting pregnant with boy and girl twins, something bigger is at play here",
  "\u201d Throughout hearing the news of my cancer diagnosis, and then the ensuing treatment options and recovery, I always wondered what exactly our journey was supposed to be",
  " Why would I finally meet the man of my dreams to then have my image of our perfect lives ripped away from me",
  " Maybe our story is meant to inspire hope to people who have lost it",
  " When we thought that life was throwing us an obstacle that we weren\u2019t prepared to face, an angel named Heather swooped in and gave us options",
  " I will always love her for that",

  "Dedication: To all those who are dreaming of being together with their families abroad",
  "When me and my husband got married on March 2009, it never slipped our minds that one day, we would separate ways because either of us had to work abroad",
  " But we really never know what God has in store for us, so when my husband was given the chance to work here in Canada, at first we were both excited but as the day for his departure drew nearer and nearer, it was also getting harder and harder for me, for him and for our son, to accept that we will be an \u201cincomplete\u201d family, well physically speaking, for a time",
  " When he left for Canada last July 2015, our son was only 3yrs",
  "old then",
  " But at a young age, he already showed signs of depression and anxiety of being away from his Daddy and that was the hardest consequence I think, that we all had to bear\u2026 living in what the three of us call a \u201cLong Distance Family Relationship\u201d",
  "Everything seemed incomplete",
  " Celebrating my husband&#8217;s first birthday in Canada, our first Christmas, New Year, Mine and my son\u2019s birthday, Valentine\u2019s Day, our wedding anniversary and all other occasions that we used to celebrate together seemed so incomplete because we were apart",
  "In 2016, I would say this was the hardest time of all",
  " We were facing so many problems and struggles",
  " Me and my spouse had marital problems which almost lead us to separation",
  " My in laws were facing such challenges too and because we are family, emotional, physical and mental stress added more to what I was feeling then and what my condition was at that time",
  " I almost wanted to break down and was really at my lowest point",
  " But, God truly loves me, for at that time when everything else was failing, HE embraced me with so much love and comfort",
  " HE never failed me",
  " Slowly I began to heal",
  " I was able to move forward and appreciate more the things and the people who are around me",
  " I have learned how to become a more loving mother to our son and a forgiving and understanding wife to my husband",
  "Fast forward to 2017",
  "There were still times when I felt sad seeing most of our friends leaving for Canada to be with their families",
  " It wasn\u2019t really a feeling of envy, I guess it was more of a question, when will it be the time for us to be complete again",
  "January 27 \u2013 on our son\u2019s birthday, my husband took the CELPIP exam for the 4th time and at that moment I felt, he was going to pass it and he did",
  " A week after my birthday, the result came out and it was one of the best birthday gifts that me and my son have received",
  "But another struggle that we had to face in relation to his Permanent Resident (PR) application was the change in the process and score that he must reach to be eligible in the Express Entry",
  " There was a dramatic change on the score and we had to meet more requirements which entailed more financial expenses",
  "On Feb 10 \u2013 My husband applied for his educational credential assessment",
  " On April 4 he was able to receive the report",
  " THANK GOD that he was able to receive it in a timely manner",
  "On Mar 4 \u2013 I took an IELTS exam",
  " This was one of the things that I can consider as an accomplishment since I had no time to review for this but still managed to get a high score thus, 16 points out of the 20 points, were contributed to Harold\u2019s application",
  " PRAISE GOD",
  "On Mar 24 \u2013 My husband applied for a renewal of his passport",
  " This was also something that I can attest that God is truly guiding us",
  " It was only by accident that I was able to read about the rule on work permit extension, thus the need for the immediate renewal of his passport",
  " He was able to get his new passport on May 22, just in time for his Work Permit Extension application",
  " GOD IS TRULY GOOD",
  "After all the processes that we went through, still the points didn\u2019t meet the required score to receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for PR",
  " But, we weren\u2019t feeling down at all because we were supposed to apply for a spousal sponsorship by the time he gets his work permit renewed",
  " So there was something to look forward to by July or August",
  "On April 24-25 \u2013 I attended an overnight silent retreat",
  " It was my first time to undergo a silent retreat so it was really a moment with God alone",
  " And because my heart and my mind were at peace, I was able to hear clearly God\u2019s message and promise to me",
  " As I was hearing His voice I was writing it in my notebook with closed eyes and this was HIS message:&#8220;Trust in Me for I have set everything for you and your family",
  " This year I promise you that you will be complete and everything will be provided to you",
  " Do not worry for I have set everything and that my plans will please you",
  " You will be happy and Kharlo will be very happy to be with his dad",
  " Harold will continue serving me and all of you will do the same",
  " Praise and worship me and I will provide you with everything you need and ask for",

  " You are blessed and your family is blessed",
  " Open your heart to me and learn to forgive",
  " Forgive everyone who has wronged you",
  " Forgive yourself, forgive Harold, forgive everyone",
  " Continue to praise and worship me and all shall be well",
  "&#8221;From then on I held on to HIS promise and just after I stepped out from that retreat, everything seemed so clear and peaceful",
  " I started receiving all these wonderful news",
  "April 26 &#8211; I got accepted in another job and was earning extra aside from my regular work",
  "April 27 \u2013 I found out that my promotion at work has been approved and will receive a retroactive payment of 1 yearMay 25 \u2013 My husband was able to apply for an extension of his work permitMay 26 \u2013 The most unexpected thing happened",
  " We finally got our ITA",
  " It was really a blessing from God and I remembered God\u2019s promise to me",
  " It was for some miraculous reason that the supposed 413 points that we had to meet to be able to receive an ITA went down to 199, just for the stream that my husband was in to",
  " I really can\u2019t explain why it had happened but it is with so much joy that we claim that it is God\u2019s plan for us and that HE is keeping His promise",
  "It was also on May 26 that I received the retroactive pay for my promotion and for some reason, the amount that I got, covered the amount that me and my son needed to have our medical done",
  " God truly laid everything on our paths",
  "July 11- My husband had his medical done",
  "July 24 &#8211; We finally submitted our PR application and so the waiting game was on",
  "July 28 &#8211; We passed our medicals and background check was in progress",
  "September 1\u2013 At a very short time, we finally got our PR approved and our passports were requested for visa stamping",
  " PRAISE GOD",
  "After everything we\u2019ve been through, I can\u2019t help but to remember and look back at God\u2019s promise and He truly was faithful to it",
  " Now we can say that we are home and that we are COMPLETE, in this perfect time that HE had planned for us",
  "Note: I made this testimony on July 28, 2017 so I had no idea when our application will be approved but God kept on telling me that it will be on September so I wrote that month in this draft and true enough, we got approved on September 1",
  " God is truly AMAZING",
  " Now, we are here in Canada as a complete family, starting a new life full of God\u2019s provision and blessings",

  " My weekends previously filled with fun family outings became quiet nights in front of a television or trips without daddy",

  " The man I fell in love with was no longer with me",
  " As time went on, I had found my own therapy for these stressors",

  " I had hit my very lowest point in life",
  " Far too often, a friend would bring me home, and I would quietly stumble inside, collapsing wherever was closest or most convenient",

  " Every time I spoke with him, I was raging with anger",
  " The majority of time we spoke, he would speak to me so calm, and it would make me question him more",
  " The constant question was, how could he even be treating me with respect right now",
  " There was no way he was sincere",
  "When I was about 8 months pregnant, I called him in anger, but when I hung up, I had this constant feeling of \u201cwhat if",

  " After I texted him my feelings, he brought me a recording of a message from church on forgiveness",

  "After several sessions with our therapist, Josh and I made a commitment to each other to save our marriage",
  " Although we knew this would not be an easy process, we were resolved to be steadfastly dedicated to one another",
  " The following months proved to be an emotional roller coaster",
  " We had to both be giving 100%, sometimes more",
  " At times life would just about seem normal, and one of us would have a wound that would appear from the past",
  " We had to focus on each others\u2019 needs, not just our own",
  " We had to be able to allow each other to heal at the speed best for them",
  " We had to remember we were a team",
  " We surrounded ourselves with people that supported us, showed us love, and held us accountable",
  " We had to put our lives back together as one after we had already started building lives without each other",
  " Our hearts were humble, our hearts were open, and our hearts were redeemed",
  "Perhaps the biggest blessing to come out of this difficult time is that our three boys were able to watch the true definition of forgiveness and redemption played out in front of them",
  " From the moment they met, Garrett and Josh looked at each other with absolute adoration",
  " Garrett was automatically a daddy\u2019s boy in heart, and when he was two, Josh officially adopted him",
  " He constantly asks, \u201cWhere\u2019s Daddy",
  "\u201d He would be happy attached to his side",
  " I watch in humble amazement as our youngest has such a precious place in so many people\u2019s hearts",
  " After five years, there are times where it seems surreal, like the whole thing was a dream",
  " There are other times where we have to rewind and address wounds we did not know existed",

  "As human flesh, I have made mistakes",
  " We all make mistakes",
  " However, the past is the past",

  " I just did the only thing that came to mind",

  " When it was time for lunch, I walked home to eat as school did not provide meals for the students",
  " A distance that would usually took me 40 minutes of walk, it took me 20 minutes that day",
  " I ran fast to reach to my mom and give her a hug, to find out she had been crying again",
  " By that time, I knew that me crying made my mom very upset, so I stayed strong, and did not even ask questions",
  " As she tried to get up and prepare lunch for me and my younger step-siblings, I encouraged her to lay down and let me take over the cooking",
  " Even though she had taught me to cook some simple meals, I wasn&#8217;t good at yet",

  " Even though my mom felt it was best to keep what she was going through to herself at that moment, she knew I was smart little girl, and one way the other, I was going to make her tell me what was going on",
  " So that same Monday as I walked back into the house from class, she had prepared one of the most delicious meal I had never eaten",
  " After we were done eating, she told me not to worry about my homework, but to take my backpack in my room then walk with her to the grocery store",
  " In our way there, she was very quiet and scared for reasons I didn&#8217;t know at the time",
  " As for me, the last thing I wanted was to make her feel as she had to do anything, especially with everything she had gone through",
  " So, I stayed quiet as well",
  " As we were walking to the store that took us 30 minutes to get to, we ran through many people in the village, doing different things",
  " When we reached to the store, my mom said to me &#8220;my daughter",
  " Get anything you want whether clothes or food",
  " Anything at all",
  "&#8221; That was her first time giving me the freedom to pick out anything I wanted, so I was very terrified and wondered why she would say that",

  " After that, she had me go with her to her favorite thinking spot",
  " A place where she loved to go and think",

  " A half an hour, an hour or two went by with her just repeating that exact same work",
  " Except the last time, she added &#8220;I am sorry my beautiful daughter",
  "&#8221; Then she said, &#8220;I feel horrible for what I am about to say to you, but I must do so for your safety and because I love you more than anything",
  "&#8221; I responded saying, mom, you can tell me anything",
  " I am strong little girl, you said it yourself",
  " And then she finally found courage to say the words she had fighting hard to tell me",
  " She said &#8221; three months ago",
  " I went to see doctor Bennett&#8230;",
  " He told me that I was HIV positive",
  "&#8221; To be honest for a kid growing up in Africa, I had not cruel what she was talking about",
  " So, I asked, what is HIV mom",
  " And why do you cry or feel bad when you talk about it",
  " Should I be worried",
  " My mom wasn&#8217;t surprised to find out I didn&#8217;t know what she was talking about",
  " So, she decided to explain it to me word by word",
  " She said many words, in which many of them I don&#8217;t remember",
  " But all I could think of as she explained was how I was going to survive without her",
  " She was my whole world",
  " My everything",
  " For about 10 minutes, I couldn&#8217;t contain myself, so I started crying with anger",
  " Mostly I was angry to myself for letting my mother fight the battle alone those past last 3 months I didn&#8217;t know",
  " I hated myself and felt as I should have known or placed her to tell me",
  " Both my mom and I continuously kept on crying",
  " However, she contained herself first, then tried her best to calm me down",
  " She said to me &#8220;it&#8217;s not your fault you didn&#8217;t know sooner, and you&#8217;ve been my strongest hold through it all",
  " Look, you&#8217;ve been taking care of me and your siblings, even though you didn&#8217;t know what was going on with me",
  " I love you my daughter",
  "&#8221; That alone helped me calm down and stopped crying",
  " Even though she told me, she had me promise to not tell anyone, not even my siblings or aunts and uncles",
  " She wanted to do it herself on her own term",
  " As we walked back home, I could see a relief in her",
  " She was much happier than before",
  " As the days went by, she started teaching me all safety procedures to help her prevent me, my siblings and others from being affected by HIV",
  " She had me start taking notes to everything she was saying, and will make me review them every day after school",
  " Few weeks later, we divided the housing stuffs in two categories",
  " One for me and my siblings and the other for my mom",
  " So, I gathered all my siblings",
  " I showed them which items of the house they should use and the ones they shouldn&#8217;t use",
  " They were too young to understand what was happening, but I tried to explain it to them without telling them the reasons for all the changes",
  " They were so unlike me, and made it easy for me by not asking too much questions",
  " I just don\u2019t know if I would had been able to hide it from them if they had asked",
  " My mother continuously followed through with all her treatments with her doctor, but instead of getting better, she was getting worse day by day",
  " That time she knew it was time to tell the rest of her family",
  " When everyone heard of the news, there was a lot of tears and confusions in the hospital room",
  " My mom was amazing, very respected women, they all couldn&#8217;t understand how that was possible",
  " But then they forgot that my stepdad was womanizer",

  " The business trip he was sent to was getting paid to sleep with hookers in the big city of Dar Salam",
  " But he lied to both mom, me and his own children that he got offered a job as a police officer",
  " Two weeks before returning home, he had found out he was HIV positive",
  " But due to his selfishness and wickedness, he did not stop once to think before sleeping with my mom",
  " So, he was the person whom my mom got it from",
  " Her own so called alcoholic and prostitute husband",
  " The hurtful thing of it all was when he found out mom was sick, he took off and never returned home",
  " We tried contacting him, but he was not where to be found",
  " To make matters worse, all his family blamed my mother and did not want anything to do with us anymore",
  " They stopped contacting and visiting us",
  " A year later, my mother had gotten even worse",
  " She had become so skinny to the point when we looked at her, all we saw was bones, not a single muscle left on her body",
  " From time to time, looking at her alone for someone my age was scary enough, but I stood by herself through it all",
  " My mom side&#8217;s family tried to help the best way they could as well",
  " On June 9, 2003, I paid a visit to see my sibling\u2019s grandparents seeking for help, but they threw me out like a garbage bag",
  " I had never been so angry in my entire life",
  " However, there was one of my stepdad sister who was always so nice and would visit us from time to time",
  " I went to her for a help",
  " She came with me to my place and helped me get my mother to hospital with the help of my mother\u2019s brother",
  " When we got to the hospital, doctor told us it was best she stayed in the hospital",
  " My mother stayed in hospital for another year and half before she died",
  " And that whole year and half, I stayed with her",
  " I never once left her side",
  " As I watched the HIV seeking in her and eating her alive, I felt powerless and unworthy because everything I did was helpless",
  " It was not helping her feel better",
  " But during the time she was in hospital, she made sure I knew and understood how to take care of myself",
  " She taught me everything she believed I would need to survivor once she was gone",
  " I made many promises to every lesson she taught me, to always follow them no matter the consequences",
  "You see, you might wonder why I am sharing this store of my beloved mom, whom I highly believe is in heaven right now watching over me every day of my life",
  " See, my life changed the day my mom found out she had aids, even though I didn&#8217;t know until 3 months later",
  " My mom suffered a whole lot more because people or family who was supposed to be there for her weren&#8217;t there as needed",
  " She was strong and a fighter",
  " She fought hard to live a little longer for her children even though she was in a lot of pain",
  " That&#8217;s the kind of mother she was",
  " If she had all the support she needed from everyone, there&#8217;s not a single hesitation in seeing her living another 5 or 10 years",
  " Again, because she was a fighter who never quit and gave up",
  " If the man who brought the sickness and his family would have stayed by her side, maybe she would not have died carrying a lot of burdens",
  " My mom died with lots of pain, not from her sickness alone, but mostly from others",
  " The night before mother died, I slept by her side",
  " When I woke up in the morning, she was gone",
  " I started crying, screaming out loud saying why me",
  " I was left with a broken heart, feeling lonely and scared than ever before",
  " I became an orphan without a mother, father or a home that very moment",
  "You see, my mother was kind, caring, loving women toward everyone",
  " She did not deserve what she went through",
  " After my mom died, I dedicated my entire life to never allow anyone else to be treated like she was",
  " I promised myself to always be loving and giving",
  " I promised myself to be there, especially when people needed me most",
  " I promised myself to be better and a good different",
  " I promised myself to never allow people like my stepdad take control of others",

  " Gardening was what we did as a collective activity apart from him storytelling over a cup of tea",
  " He is no more, but what he has left behind are memories of him inspiring me to be the best that I can",
  " By introducing me to great books and emphasizing on the need to communicate well, he prepared me for life in a way I would never have envisioned had I been in his shoes",

  " Hate developed and we drifted apart",
  " I swore I would not see my parents once I was adult enough to leave home and that\u2019s exactly what I did when I turned 18 and left home",
  " Went back to see them again at 22 but much had changed",
  " He had aged considerably and was much thinner and weaker now",
  " Mental illness was an issue we were not aware of in those days and we thought he was senile",
  " Instead of treating him, we would force him to act nice to people and didn\u2019t understand his anxiety",
  " I was 28 when he passed away all of a sudden and the night before he had tried to call me but I was too pissed with him over something he had said, and refused to talk to him",

  " Each one of them changed part of me and was present in my life whenever I needed them",
  " They never failed to remind me that Life is Beautiful",
  "So much has been said and written about sexual harassment of late",
  " Much of it attributed to sexual harassment on campuses of colleges and universities, particularly in North America, and left the voice of abused in silence",
  " In all these writing less has been said about the hyper sexualised society where we often overlook the importance of consent attributed with sexual behaviour",
  " Thoughts get strangled up in trying to analyse blame of such abuses lies on whom, however, every single story of any kind of abuse can not be fitted in the cluster of our previous research",
  "The shame, stigma, fear of retribution and judgment by friends and strangers alike, all contribute to the fog that inhibits a victim&#8217;s ability to process the abuse",
  " I know this because it is precisely this fog, which has led me to sharing and trying to articulate my own experience of sexual harassment",
  "My own, recent experience of being sexually harassed at a University is not unlike that of many others",
  " Indeed, I suspect my reaction, my inability to process, focus and articulate my thoughts on the subject are shared by hundreds perhaps thousands of other students across campuses across the world every year",
  " I also suspect there are but very few women who have not been the subject of sexual harassment whilst at colleges and universities",
  "Perhaps the most difficult aspect of my experience is to process, is the culture of victim blaming that followed my sexual harassment",
  " Victim blaming is both intentional and unintentionally embedded in our society, especially where the victim is a female",
  " As a foreign student, I recently graduated from a University in a country where the culture and environment were supposed to nurture peace and compassion, however, the perfect utopia turned out to be my worst nightmare",
  "Shortly after starting the new academic term, a friend and I accepted an invitation to lunch, where we were sexually harassed by a fellow classmate",
  "My experience of victim blaming came in many forms",
  " In the form of other students insensitively asking questions like \u201cwhy",
  "\u201d It came in the form of people sending well-intentioned messages of support, but wrongly assuming incorrect facts about the incident",
  " Assumptions drawn largely from over active imaginations and misguided ideas about what represent acts of sexual harassment",
  " It came in the form of curiosity; \u201cwhat dress we were wearing that day",
  "\u201dContinued victim blaming came in the form of having to endure forensic psychiatric assessment tests, conducted apparently to prove we were mentally stable and not lying about the incident",
  " The test required us to answer more than 500 questions, mostly personal in nature; relationships, sexual orientation, alcohol consumption etc",
  ", all in an effort to prove our credibility and mental sanity",
  "Victim blaming did not end with such intrusive tests",
  " Rather, it continued to follow a trail where lawyers wanted us to prove, six months after the incident that it did indeed happen and our stories corroborated",
  " I assumed, albeit wrongly, that all this would lead down a path where I would find empathy and due compassion for my traumatic experience",
  " Instead, I was repeatedly forced to relive the shock and trauma of the incident, to prove my innocence",
  "It almost took me a year to say out loud that, yes, I was afraid; I was ashamed of the feeling that someone touched me without my consent",
  " It took me a year to say, the feeling of being touched by another person without my consent disguised me for a while to even touch myself",
  " I was scared to go out of my house every single day to face people and being judged by others for an incident I did not had control over",
  " It took me a year to realise it was not my fault that I had undergone such experience, if it was not me or my friend it could have been someone else",
  " A year of mistrusting your own feelings and thoughts almost made me feel like being alive without a soul to embrace yourself",
  "All these feelings were attributed because as a victim you are doubted, mistrusted and subjected to having your integrity questioned",
  " Perhaps I should have put more thought into the idea of going for lunch with a fellow student, or perhaps I should have found my own path for dealing with the incident instead of seeking help",
  " Rather than the perpetrator, it is I who feels the guilt; I shoulder the burden of going through such an experience",
  "The burden of guilt is mine, and mine alone",
  " Society neither bares, nor shares responsibility for such guilt",
  " My voice has got lost somewhere amongst the noise of people discussing my personal life, appropriating blame, trying to make sense of an incident they know little about",
  "Schedules are prepared, appointments made and scripts distributed detailing how we are to behave after we are have been sexually harassed",
  " They will tell us how much we are allowed to cry; how much we can, and possibly should react",
  " We\u2019re told how much you are allowed to be scared, or how much we can speak for ourselves",
  " Anything performance outside the script would make you outcast of the social circle, and you would be ridiculed for",
  "The truth, my truth, much like my voice is also getting lost",
  " My truth is questioned, endlessly",
  " My feelings are no longer my own, rather the feelings of others telling, better placed to tell me how I should feel",
  "The perpetrator of course avoids such intrusions",
  " He can flee or choose not to participate in the legal process by other means",
  " Is it any wonder why so many victims remain silent after such experiences",
  "Our University preached about its zero tolerance approach to incidents of sexual harassment, yet proved to be unprepared to handle such cases",
  " Does the \u2018process\u2019 of victim blaming contribute to a system where the perpetrators are give the benefit of the doubt or escape punishment",
  " Where victims have to prove their innocence",
  "We failed over and over again to affirm that consent is the key in engaging in sexual acts of any sort",
  " Every individual has right over his or her own body",
  " Every individual has the right to say \u2018no\u2019",
  "Doesn&#8217;t every victim have the right to believed",
  " To be heard, to be treated with dignity, and to seek justice",
  "\u00a0It does not matter what you wear, what your level of alcohol consumption, how many friends you have, what your sexual orientation is, or how frequently you engage in sexual relationships; these are personal choices",
  " They don&#8217;t excuse unwanted attention or sexual harassment",
  "We need to focus on the victim; on the process of validation and on the process of healing",
  " There needs to be a focus on improved support structures, safety, and on safe, confidential spaces where there is no judgement and no guilt",
  " Victims should get to decide the time, place and space to be heard, to communicate",
  " My healing process started from having support of a small group who did not ask, neither pressured to share but supported me throughout the time by being there in silence, and bestowing love, support and care; by finding small moments to assure that with them I have a safe place to live, breathe and shine",

  " I knew that I was going to suffer this for a long time and I knew that eventually, I would have to get used to it",
  " I would have to learn that my penetrating screams were not going to save me, that attempting and quite clearly failing at trying to get my relentless parents to not hurt me",
  " The vindictiveness that surrounded them was almost hideous",
  " There was nothing that I could ever do that would be seen to them as right",
  " I was forever in the wrong",
  " I was wrong for crying when I was scared and frightened",
  " My mother &#8211; Annie would go to such lengths to keep this a secret that when they would take me to church she would wrap soft fluffy tissue around my body to make me look larger and she would make my clothes look bigger than normal to hide and cover up all signs of abuse",
  " She would even go out and get material to add onto the clothes to not only make the style of clothing look different by to disguise the lack of fat and body tissue that I should have had",
  "Both my parents were equally as bad",
  " They would bruise my skin so badly that sometimes I would wear makeup to school to hide the bruises, marks, and countless scars",
  " My first memory of the abuse was the day of my 1st birthday",
  " This was when my father first sexually assaulted me and when my mother first beat me up",
  " They were the ideal couple when it came down to all types of abuse and their unfortunate mascot of pain was me",
  " I was their winning medal, their trophy and their dream of a future",
  " My father could do what he wanted to do to me and my mother would never stand in his way",
  " I could not stop him even if I wanted to, and Annie she was as useless as a broken robot, just following Albert and playing this devilish game",
  " My father &#8211; Albert was more brutal than Annie",
  " This was down to him getting away with abuse for many years",
  " He would do unimaginable things to me",
  " He would hurt me in such a passionate way that he would enjoy every second of it",
  " And yes the abuse was not just physical, Albert would sexually abuse me from a very early age",
  " He did it in a way of absolute excellence",
  " I knew that he was doing things that were immoral",
  " But the abuse occurred on a regular basis, everything that my dad was doing to me was normal",
  " It was my version of normal because I did not know any better and I did not for a while",
  " Things that no one should ever do to anyone",
  " But there was nothing that she could do about it, no amount of screams and crying would ever make it stop",
  " My father would rape me every chance he was given",
  " Albert never felt shame or guilt",
  " Albert only felt pleasure and enjoyment",
  " Albert was incapable of seeing that what he was doing to me was completely and utterly wrong",
  " Albert was completely dismissive of my feelings and emotions, he did not care that he was hurting me, he did not care when he would see my blood and he did not care that when he would throw every devastating punch that I may never wake back up",
  " He could never see past the tears that I would cry nor would he ever understand the agonizing pain that I was in throughout the act and afterwards",
  " He would take advantage of me with no second thought",
  " He would do such an act of nastiness without thinking or even considering the consequences of it",
  "Between the ages of 1-5, my father would rape me (with his hands and objects) whenever he could and my mother would stand by and encourage him",
  " When I was 6 my father raped me (with his genitals) and continued to do so until I was 12",
  " The reason he stopped was that my mother told him I had started my period",
  " My mother was equally as evil causing physical/mental harm and neglect throughout my life for as long as I can remember",
  " They never care nor did they ever love me",
  " I was an unloved child, who was like discarded trash that never quite made it to the bin",
  " I believed that happiness was a day without pain and torture",
  " They would do unspeakable things to me",
  " I also used to run away and self-harm",
  "The first professional who knew something was going wrong at home was my nursery teacher and that was a complete mistake, I never intended for anyone to ever know let alone my school",
  " The way she found out was worse, I was in the playground at nursery and I took off my jacket, socks, and shoes and fell asleep next to tree all curled up on the grass and moss and had a little kip",
  " The teacher came back and noticed that something was very different about my hands and feet, they did not look the same",
  " I had taken off my socks and shoes, and my jacket",
  " My teacher saw something very disturbing, something that she has not seen before at her work place and something she did not know what to do about it besides cry",
  " What she saw changed her outlook on children, she did not make the assumptions that everything was alright, especially at home",
  "So she woke me up, I have had my sleep, though I was still confused as to why she has rudely woken me up from my slumber",
  " The first thing she said was &#8220;I know what is going on at home&#8221;, I was confused and then realized what she had said",
  " Her teacher then went and asked her why her arms and legs were a deep painful purple with a tinge of navy blue",
  " I had to think fast and I said that I was playing at home, that I was running around with my dad and that I fell down the stairs and hurt my arms and legs",
  " The teacher knew straight away that what I had said was incorrect, that it was far from the truth, all you had to do was look at my face and at the bruisers you knew it was all lies",
  " You could clearly see hand imprints still there almost like they were painted onto my skin, just simply looking at the colour of the marks you knew a fall down the stairs did not make them appear",
  " I pleaded with the teacher to not say a word",
  " I cried and I could not stop crying",
  " I did not want anyone to know, not my parents or any of the teachers, I just wanted my bruises to be forgotten about like they were never seen or discovered",
  "I thankfully went through primary school with no one ever saying anything about it which for me was the best thing that could ever do for me",
  " When I was 13 finally plucked up the courage and told my high school about the abuse I received at home but only a little part and social services got involved",
  " I escaped what was happening by firstly running away from my parents and then from the school",
  " When that didn\u2019t work I would self-harm, at first it was for myself but then I realized the school was finally taking me seriously",
  " After I showed and proved there was a significant risk I was then able to place myself in care at the age of 13 with the aid of my wonderful social worker and solicitor",
  "When I was 15 after I had moved to the best placement ever, I finally had the courage to tell social services what was happening at home but even then I was scared to tell them everything",
  " What did help was learning about other survivors, hearing their stories and igniting myself to do the same",
  " I learned so much about myself which I can put into practice thus helping to aid my recovery",
  " Truth be told, there is no one who knows the full story of my childhood",
  " For me, help lines were amazing, if I ever needed someone I would pick one at random number and call",
  " I would talk about my past, present and the future",
  " One aspect that will help heal and rebuild my life is when I finish writing my book and it is published",
  " Then I can tell my story with every single detail",
  " With my recovery, I am now able to live the life that I want to have, I am able to change my life, change my fate and change my story",
  " I can do what I want with my life without living in fear of my horrendous past",
  " I can now move on and forward and conquer anything",
  "No matter what you suffered it was never your fault, not now and not ever",
  " The violence and abuse is not your fault",
  " The struggles you went through were not your fault",
  " Never blame yourself",
  " Whatever the reasons for the violence/abuse I can and it will never be justified",
  " I would suggest that you speak out, no matter who it is or what the circumstances are",
  " You get out there, find people, contact helplines and speak to the police",
  " It can be daunting and it will be scary but if you keep it bottled up for a while you will eventually explode and that explosion will not just be deadly for you but for others around you",
  " It\u2019s important to share what your experiences, maybe with someone you trust like someone who will be there for you to listen and give you the right support",
  " Talking about what has happened to you can make an enormous difference and can feel like a great weight being lifted from you",
  "I learned to accept my self no matter what, I knew that what happened to me was indeed wrong but I also knew that one day I would get through it all and become the young woman I am now",
  " I knew that one day I would get there, I knew the journey would be long and hard but what motivated me the most was that I knew that at the end I would be all over and done with",
  " The breakthrough moment was finding my inner voice and telling myself that every day I would tell someone and one day I finally did and it was the best thing I could have done for myself",
  " Learning and realizing that not only what was happening to me would not only damage me for years to come but it also made me realize that if I never spoke out when I did then I probably would never have done so, in all fairness I would probably be dead if I didn\u2019t say something",
  " I overcame everything by realizing that I was worth more than what I had been put through, by showing myself that I could make a better future for myself",
  " It was hard telling people as I was ashamed by all that had happened, I was scared about how they would react to me, if they would be the same with me but with all of that I said to myself that this is my life and no one else and if I lost people because of what I suffered then maybe it\u2019s for the greater good",
  " I move on with my life, I changed my path and I am the only one who can make my future the one that is perfect for me",
  " Just remember you are not your past, what happened, happened and this is your chance to let go, start over and move on, it will be tough but so are you",
  " You can do things when you put your mind to it",
  " If you want to change then make a change, don\u2019t wait for someone else to tell you",

  "The story of my journey",
  "A year ago, almost to the day, I sat crying with my parents and brother at the dining table in my family home",
  "I had everything",
  " Two children who make my heart burst with pride, a keeper of a husband, an incredible job in education, a beautiful home in a stunning location, the love of my family",
  "But I sat and cried because I felt desperately sad inside",
  "And then came the catalyst that propelled me into the journey which I have taken this year and which has been a slow journey from darkness into light",
  "\u201cYou don\u2019t need to feel like this",

  " You just need to face up to it and talk about it",
  " It\u2019s simple",
  " Life can get better",
  "\u201dAnd with that, something shifted",
  " Hearing my brother talk out loud about the thing that has hung over me for forty years was like a shift in the space-time continuum and suddenly I could see that what he had said made perfect sense",
  "I decided to write the Story of My Self",
  "I got out the diaries, letters and writing that help to pull together the pieces of that story and I connected them together, reflecting and analysing as I did",
  "As I wrote, I also read and found the words of four key voices inspired me to keep going:Matt HaigDr Tim O BrienEmma WoolfJK Rowling",
  "And in writing, I began truly to heal",
  "Taking time to stop, to see, to realise that all the things I know, as a teacher and therapist, about how to help and heal other children are the the things that will finally help and heal me",
  "Through writing, I shaped and developed my mantra:\u201cLife is not perfect",
  " Bad things happen and we can\u2019t always control events around us",
  " There are good feelings as well as bad",
  " But we can have control over our thoughts and our actions if we understand, deeply, who we are and why we have behaved in certain ways in the past",
  "\u201dIn August, I put my Story out into the world",
  " The trepidation and anxiety that went with that were considerable but I did it anyway and slowly began to use social networks to share it",
  "And the sharing has enabled me to connect, be supported by and support others in way that was unimaginable to me until I did it",
  "You can try (as some have) to tell me that these connections are not real, that these relationships are shallow, that I am replacing human connection with false, electronic pseudo-attachment",
  "But these connections have saved me over the past year",
  " I do not write that lightly",
  "I am someone who could never previously have talked to people in the room with me about the things I have shared through writing and virtual communication",

  "Dedication: Monika AllenIn my early teens, we moved to San Diego after many years in Newport Beach, CA",
  " This move forced me to leave the only friends I had known and start a new life",
  " Once in San Diego, I was tagged with the identity of &#8220;new girl&#8221; which left me feeling isolated and with low self esteem",
  " I needed a way to make friends",
  " My mother signed me up for Girls On The Run [GOTR], which teaches girls ages 8 &#8211; 10 to accept and to love themselves for who they are while also getting the benefits of exercise",
  " I showed up for the first day of practice not knowing what to expect",
  " But, as the weeks went on, I was able to proudly say that I had made friends in my community",
  " Soon, the vast area that was San Diego began to feel more and more like home and, based on my GOTR lessons, I had begun to view myself in a different way",
  " I did not fully realize it at the time, but I was developing an improved self-image",
  " The lessons I&#8217;d learned from GOTR guided me through my high school years",
  " Therefore, in my junior year, I was inspired to give back by volunteering to be an assistant coach for GOTR at Stone Ranch Elementary School",
  " Our season got off to a great start with 12 girls, 3 enthusiastic assistant coaches and 1 experienced head coach",
  " During each lesson I learned alongside the girls and I saw friendships begin to blossom",
  " As the season went on, our head coach had to resign due to a work conflict",
  " Since none of the older assistant coaches could assume the head coach role, the program was left in uneasy waters",
  " However, I hoped that it would continue because I understood the program&#8217;s value from my own prior experience",
  " Therefore, I offered, at 16 years old, to become head coach, even though I knew that the minimum age requirement was 21",
  " The GOTR administration was hesitant at first, but I was persistent, and eventually was able to convince them I was up for the task",
  " Having no experience in this area, it was a struggle at first",
  " Planning the lessons and coordinating people&#8217;s calendars took an unexpectedly large amount of time and effort",
  " I had to push myself in directing the assistant coaches since they were much older and more experienced than I was",
  " I learned what to do by \u201ctrial and error\u201d",
  " I wrote the program emails multiple times in order find the best way to communicate important information to the assistant coaches",
  " I worked on setting up the lessons so that the girls could have some fun along the way",
  " Sometimes, we would run out of time, therefore, I had to make adjustments to the lessons in order to finish while not losing focus on the key messages",
  " It was a real struggle to balance all these new demands with my school schedule, however, my academic performance still met my goals",
  " With hard work and practice, we ended the season successfully having every girl finish the 5K race",
  " GOTR has truly impacted my life in a positive way",
  " I am honored to have been able to help preserve a community program as well as to help young girls form friendships in their immediate neighborhood",
  " Even better, it&#8217;s been very satisfying to see the girl&#8217;s self-image improve",
  " These rewards mentioned above seemed to be a pivotal benefit for the girls and the balancing of my schedule alongside learning to be a head coach seemed to be a tough but manageable challenge",
  " I believe that the coaches and I made a significant, positive impact on these girl&#8217;s lives",

  " I&#8217;m a black sheep",
  "I was born in April 1993 in Ventura, California, not too far from the ocean",
  " Ever since then, I&#8217;ve always had a deep, unconditional love of the ocean and pretty much anything associated with water",
  " That might seem surprising, contradictory even, when you see me say my one true home is northern Nevada",
  " My first memories originate there",
  " I have so many memories of walking home from school with my older brother who&#8217;s eight years older than me (i",
  "e",
  ", he was preparing to go to college when I was still in elementary school) or my dad, playing outside on my Razor scooter or in the dirt, and watching cartoons, movies, Saturday Night Live, and Monty Python on a regular basis",
  "Do you ever hear a song or a name or see something totally innocuous and it triggers a memory in you",
  " Every time I hear anything off Led Zeppelin IV or Dark Side of the Moon, I always think back to being an elementary school girl on the swing set and staring off to the sparse vegetation on the hills north of Carson City and just being engrossed in thought",
  " Every time I hear the names Darrell Hammond, Rachel Dratch, Kevin Nealon, David Spade, John Cleese, Craig McCracken, and Lauren Faust, I fall back into this little blissful cloud",
  " I see the number \u201c1998\u201d and I think of being a kindergartener drawing on the sidewalk with chalk or being in show choir",
  " I actually remember the whole Y2K hysteria",
  " I recently saw a photo of one of those stickers proclaiming \u201cremember to turn off your computer on December 31, 1999\u201d and just thought \u201cwow, I actually remember seeing those in places like Best Buy and (heh) Circuit City",
  "\u201d I&#8217;ve always felt this innate curiosity to explore: I would always think about what&#8217;s \u201cout there\u201d past the neighboring houses, beyond the hills, beyond Carson County",
  " I always wanted to go on road trips and read books, expand my horizons really",
  " I met the members of Tool and also Tony Stewart when I was in kindergarten, too",
  " It was around that time I dreamed about being a published author like J",
  "K Rowling or C",
  "S Lewis or Lemony Snicket and I had all the food I could ever ask for while living in a cute little house on the coast, either by myself or with a cute husband",
  "Of course, it wasn&#8217;t all rosy",
  " I had my best friend in elementary school and she and I loved each other like sisters, but I often seeked out solitude",
  " I just always felt comfortable by myself and it&#8217;s landed me in trouble a few times",
  " My mom was hard working, sometimes she&#8217;d stretch herself thin and it never sat well with me (it still doesn&#8217;t)",
  " My dad was an alcoholic and an addict: there were days he&#8217;d be on it and walk me right to school since we only lived a few blocks away, but there were days he&#8217;d be a total bump on the log",
  " I remember my parents&#8217; fights would often get so loud: not necessarily violent, just a lot of yelling",
  " It scared my brother and me so much that we&#8217;d hide out in the other room for sometimes hours: we&#8217;d hang out in his room with his little TV and I would watch him play video games on his Play Station or we&#8217;d watch cartoons or Comedy Central; even at a young age, I would watch things that were supposedly \u201cmature\u201d or more grown up than something for an elementary school student, so as a young adult, I&#8217;m simply just not comfortable with these \u201cmoral guardians\u201d who think kids should only watch kid&#8217;s stuff and leave the adult stuff for adults",
  "I&#8217;ve always felt like I didn&#8217;t fit in the family, either",
  " The first thing that should tip you off is our eye color: my dad&#8217;s eyes are hazel, my mom&#8217;s are green, my brother&#8217;s are blue, and mine are brown",
  " Where my parents seemed pretty fixated on getting my brother through high school and into college, I just learned to keep to myself, burying my nose into the Harry Potter books and books about all a manner of earth science or playing outside",
  " I always loved hanging out with my grandparents, though: I was my grandpa&#8217;s granddaughter",
  " When we went to go visit them in Simi Valley and later in a little town east of the Central Valley called Tehachapi, I always loved sitting at the dining room table with grandpa (my dad&#8217;s dad) and since he had his doctorate in nuclear science, he would often tell me random facts about breeder reactors or Chernobyl, and when you&#8217;re a young child like that, you&#8217;re a sponge so I just took it in as gospel",
  " And my grandma (my mom&#8217;s mom) was basically an older version of me, now that I think about it: feisty, snarky, and curious about literally everything",
  "I developed a deep love of music at age 11 after hearing Soundgarden: I heard Fell on Black Days the first time and thought \u201cwho ARE these guys",
  " I LOVE this band",
  "\u201d I wanted a music palette of my own since everything I listened to up to that point consisted of 70s rock, adult alternative from the early 2000s, and Dave Matthews: they seemed perfect because they sounded so different from everything and everyone else",
  " I also found love in open wheel racing, particularly Formula 1 about that time, too",
  " It wouldn&#8217;t be another two years later when I found my own little cornucopia of rock n&#8217; roll and at good timing no less",
  "I was in middle school then: I hated how everyone was just so shitty to each other",
  " We&#8217;re friends today, we&#8217;re not talking to each other two days later, and we&#8217;re back to being besties the next week",
  " It always felt like I could do nothing right either: I dressed in black and I was labelled an emo",
  " I wore a beanie and I was a punk",
  " I spoke my mind and I got stared at",
  " I answered a question in class or even turned something in and I was called a teacher&#8217;s pet and a wannabe",
  " I didn&#8217;t want to talk about it to my parents or anyone because I didn&#8217;t think they&#8217;d understand or they&#8217;d brush it off as nothing more than middle school drama",
  " My skin broke out and I was gaining weight like crazy",
  "I was even more confused and isolated in seventh grade",
  " Talk about not being able to do anything right: if I even so much as opened my mouth to sneeze, I got a dirty look",
  " I was overweight and I felt gross and ashamed of my body",
  " I would often go for a whole day without eating to try to lose weight",
  " It finally came to a point I deliberately put a sharp edge to my fingers\u2014not my wrists, my fingers",
  " I quit doing that after just a few days because I hate feeling physical pain",
  " Not a day would go by when someone would rudely ask me when&#8217;s the last time I took a shower or mistake me for a boy",
  "My grandpa died in 2006 (right in the heart of seventh grade, too) from brain cancer: if you ask me, the treatment is what killed him because he was exposed to low doses of radioactive material for thirty years working in a nuclear power plant",
  " After his death, my dad&#8217;s side of the family, simply put, went crazy: there was so much fighting between my parents and my dad&#8217;s brothers",
  " Around that time, I really got into music, discovering bands like Green Day, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Stone Temple Pilots, Nine Inch Nails, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Audioslave, Black Sabbath, Korn, Tool (again",
  "), Faith No More, Metallica, Silverchair, and so many others; I also developed a great respect for the music of the 1960s and country western, motown, and R&amp;B, too (might as well: rock n&#8217; roll is descended from those three genres)",
  " I found a love of drawing then, too: I would draw a little cartoonish expy of myself, pulling influence from manga and dark art, wishing for something somewhere to make me more of a girl and to exorcize these hateful neurotic bitches around me from my life",
  "About a year later, my cousin died a slow, very progressive death of fatal injuries from a horrible car accident and it was from there that my trust for everyone on that side of the family began to slip",
  " My grandmother developed dementia that year: I don&#8217;t really have a lot of kind words to say about her because she&#8217;s always been trying to convert me to the Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses, even after I refused going to meetings and repeatedly saying no, and she&#8217;s never had anything decent to eat, or anything to eat really, after my grandpa&#8217;s death, and she&#8217;s always been a bit rude to my mom, too",
  "In high school, I thought I had found my calling by deciding to go into engineering",
  " I wasn&#8217;t the kind of kid who went to parties or wanted to kiss boys or anything like that: I just wanted to go to my classes and learn things and then return home to be with my parents or with my thoughts and my music and my drawing, which I made into a hobby",
  " I found out I have a knack for languages, too: I took French class all four years and I picked it up within seconds of the first day of class in my freshman year",
  "The bullying still continued throughout high school, except it was more about petty shit that people just wouldn&#8217;t let go, like going one day smelling like last night&#8217;s dinner or an off hand comment that just slipped out",
  " Some time in the summer between my sophomore and junior years, I decided that it&#8217;d be time to show these shallow pricks what for and decided grooming myself better: I wore more blouses and started experimenting with new soft, powdery scents and color palettes like sexy jewel tones and earth tones (my brother got married to a rather girly girl, too, so that especially helped)",
  " My senior year was bittersweet: senior year is always bittersweet, but mine was a double dose of that",
  " I took four AP classes that year, I continued my streak of being on honor roll five years in a row, I found myself wanting to become more cultured as well as knowledgeable, and I decided to go to school in Oregon\u2014I just wanted to get out of Tehachapi, anywhere else was fine just so long as I get the hell out of there",
  " But my parents divorced after nearly thirty years together two months before my graduation, my dad and I lost our house, and I was all alone in that last month, all alone when I needed good support for my AP exams, finals, and graduation",
  " My only friend at the time was my copy of Soundgarden&#8217;s album Superunknown (and decidedly my favorite album ever, too)",
  " I couldn&#8217;t talk to anyone about it",
  " In fact, I wasn&#8217;t allowed to talk about it to anyone",
  " I couldn&#8217;t even tell it to a counselor",
  " I would always get hushed or side eyed for things like that",
  "I went to Oregon by myself by train because I didn&#8217;t drive and decided not to get my license because I was going out of state anyways; although my aunt who lived in Sacramento, just a few hours down the road, helped me move into my dorm and my mom was going to be there in town attending the same school as me",
  " I decided to patch it up with her because I don&#8217;t like bearing grudges",
  " That first semester was so fun: I decided to just socialize with everyone and have fun",
  " My roommate over Christmas, though: moreover, I never found out why, so for the last semester I had the room to myself",
  " It was nice at first but by my 19th birthday, I was feeling lonely",
  " I rediscovered my love of drawing by making little cartoons of the four guys from Soundgarden",
  " I moved off campus with my mom about four blocks from school and that whole summer I just spent making art and trying to revamp the primitive style I had played with in middle school, playing around with black and blue ink and graphite",
  " That fall I fell seriously depressed: I was stressed out by class and I just wanted to make art",
  " I noticed some other emotions that I hadn&#8217;t dealt with before: like I found myself getting angry about something that happened to me in 2009 or replaying a fight between my dad and his brother over and over again",
  " I found I had dysthymia, or persistent depression, that October; I tried to take my own life three times that winter",
  " I didn&#8217;t want to have to face those emotions head on because I knew they were just cold and ugly like my body",
  " I didn&#8217;t care: I just wanted out from the suffering of being full of dark, strange thoughts and trapped in a stark, stale environment that only cares about your success and not necessarily about how you feel or who you are as a person (I&#8217;ve never liked our education system, I&#8217;ll say that much)",
  "I finally broke through to my mom that I wanted to be in the arts so the week before Spring Break 2013, we drove down to the little community college there in town to enroll me into the general arts program with the goal of going to a real art school somewhere some day",
  " I continued to struggle with emotions and mental illness for a whole year: I wrote to my hero Ben Shepherd (Soundgarden&#8217;s bassist) in March 2014 and then again for his birthday that September, telling him some of my story and his influence on me and my art and how much I want to thank him for everything really",
  " On a side note, I&#8217;ve seen Soundgarden a total of four times",
  "My mom and I moved back to Tehachapi, to an older house on a hill at just under 7000 feet, in 2015 after our graduations: neither of us wanted to leave Oregon because we love the Northwest so much (it&#8217;s another 600 miles away from Ben Shepherd, too)",
  " I saw and met Chris Cornell in Santa Barbara that September: I got to shake his hand, get an inch from his face, and give him a painting; he was a fan of my cartoons, too, and when I thought for sure no one would see or care about them, either",
  " All the while, my dad had gotten sober: even though I&#8217;m proud of him, I can&#8217;t help but feel he&#8217;s a different person now",
  " He always keeps telling me to do this, not that; go for this job, not that one; socialize with these people because I said so not because I think it&#8217;s a match made in heaven",
  " I finally told him to back off and he took it completely the wrong way: now the whole family thinks I&#8217;m mental and I&#8217;m going to hurt someone or myself (when I can&#8217;t even so much as kill an insect) so take me to the psych ward already",
  "I&#8217;ve always been really confused about what it means to be a woman, in particular a feminine woman",
  " My mom did, I would say an okay job of being a female role model, although she, like me, is the only girl in her family, and her mother (my grandma) was, too: I have my brother and all my cousins are boys",
  " My mom&#8217;s a tomboy and therefore I am, too",
  " I&#8217;ve probably owned all of ten dresses in my life",
  " I&#8217;m one of those girls who looks overmade when it comes to make up so I don&#8217;t even bother",
  " I do like flaunting my chest and my hips, and I&#8217;ve always had a deep love for the human belly, too: I&#8217;ve always been fascinated by weird taboos like that, something that no one really talks about and when they do it&#8217;s not in a good light",
  " But I&#8217;m definitely riding on the fine line between femininity and androgyny, and I have been since I was 16, something I get a lot of flak for, and I really want to understand why that is, too",
  "Don&#8217;t let my baby face fool you: I&#8217;ve always had this deep dark creature inside me, like a big black scorpion with her stinger aimed high, waiting to inject her lethal injection into the next bully who gaslights her or gets up all in her face",
  " I&#8217;m very much a still waters run deep person",
  " I&#8217;m naturally a recluse: if ever I&#8217;m not, I start to question the people I&#8217;m with and if they&#8217;re even worth it",
  " It&#8217;s at the point now I don&#8217;t look at people and think \u201coh, they might be interesting to speak to or befriend",
  "\u201d So, just by nature, I seek solitude",
  " I&#8217;ve been hurt so many times that it&#8217;s in my essence to choose to be alone",
  " There are times I get militant about that, like \u201cdon&#8217;t you dare tell me to go out and socialize",
  "\u201d or (one that comes up a lot) \u201cdon&#8217;t you dare tell me how to feel",
  "\u201dA recurring fantasy for me is driving up the Highway 101 (Pacific Coast Highway) from Ventura going all the way up to Seattle: just me and the ocean, and occasionally pitching a tent on the sand",
  " The ocean and any body of water is where my soul is at peace, it really is",
  " I&#8217;ve always loved taking a shower and feeling water cascade onto my head and the really soft parts of my body like my belly, or walking in the rain or a fine mist, or just being in a bath tub and laying on my back, and my upper body floats whereas my legs sink down",
  " I&#8217;ll get thoughts every now and then, wondering what it&#8217;d be like if I was a mermaid",
  " One of my favorite things ever is going to sleep with a full tummy and hearing the rain on the roof",
  " I&#8217;ve always been fascinated by thunderstorms, too, especially the nocturnal ones",
  " It&#8217;s all just me, too, I&#8217;m not with anyone else",
  " It sounds really odd once you consider I&#8217;m into team sports like softball and field hockey",
  " It sounds even more odd when you find out I&#8217;m actually not a very good swimmer",
  " It sound even more odd when you find out one of my wishes in life is to connect with another person, and they&#8217;re with me for a long time, too, not just for a brief time like my best friend in elementary school, my grandpa, or Chris Cornell",
  "It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t like people: I love people, especially men",
  " It&#8217;s just I don&#8217;t like how they usually treat me and each other",
  " It&#8217;s like there&#8217;s I can do nothing right, or adult, or competent, or whatever",
  " I don&#8217;t like how I&#8217;m always taking the back seat, whether it&#8217;s conscious or not for the other person, and they wonder why I&#8217;m often pushed to my breaking point and they never see me again",
  "I&#8217;m fighting a massive uphill battle to love myself and to heal the wounds on my spirit since February 2016 when I wrote to Ben Shepherd a third time calling him handsome and sweet and wholeheartedly telling him I loved his mom: I get so much flak for liking him too, because he&#8217;s old enough to be my dad but I love him anyways",
  " Since about 2013, I&#8217;ve been looking for female role models who are dark haired and kind of exotic looking (Rihanna, Salma Hayek, Sandra Bullock, Jane Russell, Elizabeth Taylor, Bettie Page, Ann Wilson, Amy Lee, Bjork)",
  " I still get side eyed for looking the way I do and the way I dress",
  " I get a lot of judgmental looks now more than ever because I gained a ton of weight since 2014: my face is a lot rounder and overall I&#8217;m a lot fuller than when I was 14 and skinny",
  " In all honesty, I think there&#8217;s something really sweet about having some extra softness",
  " I often feel like people patronize me, too, because I&#8217;m in the arts and I&#8217;m full of love when the arts are arguably the most human path ever, and I&#8217;m a hell of a lot smarter than I look, and love is one thing that will save us all",
  " I think no matter where I go someone will impose stupid restrictions onto me and expect too much or something that isn&#8217;t like me, but I&#8217;m still reluctant to call myself amazing",
  " It&#8217;s just difficult after 24 years of being repeatedly told, explicitly or not, that I&#8217;m not good enough and God forbid I ever own up to being a woman",
  "Simply put, it&#8217;s at the point now I can&#8217;t keep eating cake with the black wool pulled over my body anymore and I have to tell the world the whole story of nirvhannah the black sheep",
  "",
  "When you were younger, did you ever think that life as an adult was going to be easy",
  " Simple",
  " Full of happiness every day or a Cinderella wedding",
  " Well&#8230; that was me",
  "As a child of divorced parents, I was a victim of physical and mental abuse from my dad and step-mother",
  " I had gone to live with my dad after my parent&#8217;s divorced at the age of six",
  " Due to the abuse and lifestyle I had to endure throughout those years, I never felt good about myself",
  " I did not think I was ever good enough and my self-image was extremely low",
  " Finally, when I was old enough (according to the court system) to decide where I wanted to live, I moved away and went and lived with my mom and step-father for the duration of my middle school and high school years",
  " I chose to go to college close to home",
  "After college, I did not know what to do with my life",
  " I thought I was living the dream",
  " I got married and started working for a local bank where I discovered my love for people",

  " Two years later, I was a single mother",
  " Certainly not how I envisioned my life to be",
  " I was raised in a church and always told that God wouldn&#8217;t give us more than we could handle",
  " I was beginning to wonder",
  "Over the next 17 years, I have remarried and maintained a 65 pound weight loss",
  " I found my passion and addiction for exercise and nutrition",
  " I dug deep into my heart and found some love I didn\u2019t know existed on the inside",
  "I have completed several marathons, half marathons and half lronman&#8217;s",
  " In 2012, I completed my first ever lronman",

  "4 mile swim followed by a 112 mile bike and then a 26",
  "2 mile run all completed in the allotted time of 17 hours",

  " Exactly 30 days later, my husband and I were on a windy bike ride when my front tire clipped his back tire catapulting me over my handle bars into the middle of a busy highway",
  " Miraculously, I was not hit by any cars",

  " I had shattered my collarbone, broken five ribs, fractured my pelvis in three places, had bruised lungs, a torn hamstring, bruised both of my knees, received a concussion and vertigo",
  " I was transferred to a trauma center an hour away",
  " Surgically a plate and seven screws were inserted in my collarbone",
  " I spent a week in the trauma center and was then transferred to a rehabilitation center",
  " In the months following, with hours of daily physical therapy, I progressed from a wheelchair to a walker, then graduated from the walker and was allowed to walk unassisted with the help of many therapists",
  " Determined to get back on my feet and get back to training, I made an amazing recovery",
  " Fifteen months later, I was released from physical therapy and completed a half marathon",

  " That day after much convincing, I chose to ski",

  " I landed in extreme pain",
  " After being transported to our local hospital, doctors assessed my injury",
  " Again extreme",
  " A femur shattered into 15 pieces accompanied by three fractures in my knee joint",
  " The next day I was in surgery",
  " I was offered a blood transfusion which I refused",
  " I had decided if this was how God was ending my time here on earth, then I was okay with that and knew that it was my time to go",

  "   We have been working toward this date since mid March, and in that time we have watched our girls increase their endurance and their ability to run",
  "  This has been very rewarding as you might have gathered from the \u201cproud coach\u201d photos that grace my Facebook page",
  "   For a few of our girls, the 5K will mean they will take off when the gun sounds and never slow down until they cross the finish line",

  "  Finish is the one key word that comes to mind when I think of our team at Washington Elementary",
  "  I shared with you last week that we had 20 girls start the program and we have 20 girls finishing it",
  "  And for that accomplishment, I tip my hat to my two wonderful partners, Jen and Jackie",
  "  Together, armed with a great curriculum, we worked through the highs and the lows of managing 20 very different personalities, and finding a way to prove to each one that she can finish, too",

  "  Tomorrow, when she crosses that finish line with Coach Jen, I hope her brothers know that they cross it, too",
  "  Their sacrifice to make this work for her is something that is beyond impressive",
  "We have had a few girls who challenged us on several occasions with their behavior",
  "  And we have had a few \u201ccandid\u201d moments with each of them",

  "  Two of those young women are in my mind tonight",
  "  They have fought us hard at different points, but they kept coming back and so did we",
  "  And tomorrow they will finish",
  "We have another participant, Ally, who was originally scheduled to move in early May to Florida",
  "  The move was delayed, which means we had the chance to keep her in GOTR longer",
  "  But when she started the season, she started with the impression that she would only be with us to train but not to see the program through to the end",

  "  Twenty years strong and growing, this is an organization that captures my passion and connects me with so many amazing women",

  "  Yep, I know she coached this spring and that every one of the 20 girls in the program that started the program, finished it and finished the 5K",
  "  But today I want to tell you about GOTR and its impact on the universe through a story that I haven\u2019t shared with you",
  "  It is a story about my friend Kim",
  "  Kim was a fifth grader in the program that I coached",
  "  A beautiful girl, she giggled, walked with confidence and carried herself in a way that seemed a bit beyond her 11 years",
  "On one of the first days of practice, we were dismissing the girls and sorting out which of them were walkers and which of them needed a parent to pick them up",
  "  Kim had already been on our coaches\u2019 collective radar screen, as she had challenged Coach Jen from day one",
  " Looking through the list, I stopped Kim and asked her to wait&#8230;I needed to see if she was allowed to walk home without an adult",
  "  When I asked her this, she turned on her heel and gave me one of those reactions that makes you want to never lay eyes on another tween girl again",
  "  I stopped her, put down the clipboard and told her that her reaction was uncalled for and she needed to keep in mind that I was just looking out for her safety",
  "  I asked her for an apology, which she mumbled and then promptly marched off to catch up with her friends",
  "I shared the story with Devon that night",
  "  Devon, also 11 years old, had very big eyes when I told her of the interaction",
  "  I think she was a little uncomfortable with her mom \u201ccalling Kim\u201d on her behavior",
  "  I also think she was surprised that Kim would act this way towards a coach",
  "  I told Devon that I needed to call Kim on her behavior, because Kim might not have a Mom or an adult around to do so",
  "  I also reminded Devon that she has the tendency to share some of those same looks with me from time to time, and I call her on it, too",
  "  I was doing the same thing for Kim that I would do for my own daughter",
  "  I missed the following day of practice for a work meeting",
  "  It would be the only practice that I missed all season, and while I didn\u2019t think the girls would notice, Kim did",
  "  When I came back the following week, she ran up to me and asked where I had been last week",
  " I told her I had a work meeting and I was sorry to miss practice",
  " She looked at me and said, \u201cI thought you weren\u2019t coming back",
  "\u201d  I smiled and told her she couldn\u2019t scare me off that easily",
  "From that point forward, Kim became one of my favorites",
  "  She fell during a practice and I was the one to take her to the nurse",
  "  The nurse examined her and placed her arm in a bandage",
  "  While we were sitting in the office, the nurse called the emergency numbers on Kim\u2019s list",
  "  No one answered at the first number",
  "  The next two numbers were disconnected",
  "  When the nurse asked who was at home, Kim said her grandmother",
  "  When the nurse asked if her grandmother spoke English, Kim said she did not",
  "  Kim went onto say that the only English speaker in the house and the only person to contact in case of emergency was her 14 year old sister",
  "  Kim\u2019s arm was fine, but this fire drill made me wonder what would happen if she needed an adult to care for her in the case of a real emergency",
  "Kim came to every practice",
  "  She participated but you could tell she enjoyed being in the middle of her pack of girls some days more than the running",
  "  She isn\u2019t one of the girls that I expected to cross the finish line in the first wave, so when she did, I smiled",
  "  Look at that, I thought, \u201cshe had it in her all along",
  "\u201dI wrote her a note at the end of the season to tell her how proud I was of her and the progress she had made",
  "  I included a picture of her strongly crossing the finish line",
  "  When I heard back from her, she said the note \u201cmelted her heart with the words I said about her",
  "\u201d  This program and the belief in this young woman had melted more than her heart, it had melted some of her tough exterior",
  "   She wasn\u2019t the fifth grader with a bit of attitude",
  "  She was a young woman who was more confident and willing to show her love and affection for her friends and for her coaches",
  "  Look at that, I thought, \u201cshe had it in her all along",
  "\u201dI wish I could flash forward and tell you that Kim lived happily ever after",
  "  I don\u2019t know that yet, but I do know that Girls on the Run enabled her to see that \u201cshe had it in her all along",
  "\u201d  She had the physical strength and stamina to be competitive in the 5k",
  "  More importantly, she had the emotional strength and stamina to let others in and melt away some of her tough exterior",
  "  You and I both know that Kim is living in a tough world because we live in it, too",
  "  But most of us are fortunate to live in a different zip code than Kim does and many of us have had Moms and mentors who have helped us discover that \u201cwe had it in us all along",
  "\u201d  Girls on the Run finds those mentors and coaches across all zip codes and connects them with the Kims of the world so that they can discover that they, too, \u201chad it in them all along",

  "I am amazing because I\u2019m a survivor",
  " My story begins at a time when I was a young girl",
  " I was raised by a single mother, and had a drug and alcohol addicted father that was in and out of my life",
  " I never truly felt unconditional love from either parent",
  " Even though my mother tried to show me her love there was always something missing",
  " My entire childhood I struggled with finding my place",
  " I was very shy, withdrawn, and never had any self confidence",
  " I struggled to fit in with the groups at school and in my neighborhood",
  " I was often bullied and the easy target to many of other girls jokes",
  " I never told anyone about how I felt, or was being treated because I felt I would become a burden to them",
  " All I wanted was to just fit in and have friends",
  " At the age of 11 I was attacked by a random stranger at a park I went to frequently",
  " My attacker ended up cutting my right cheek, and I spent an entire afternoon laying in the emergency room for 4 plus hours as a surgeon placed 152 stitches to close the wound",
  " I remember thinking to myself why me",
  " How am I going to deal with this",
  " How bad will it look",
  " After the surgeon was done I was allowed to use the bathroom",
  " As I walked into the bathroom I remember entering the room with my back turned away from the mirror",
  " I took a deep breath and found the courage to turn around",
  " As I turned around I found myself looking straight at my cheek",
  " I leaned in closer to look at myself and broke into tears",
  " As the days, weeks, and months went by I dealt with many people staring, whispering, and asking me about what happened",
  " It got so bad that I didn&#8217;t want to go out in public anymore",
  " Until one day a girl at school came up to me and said that she felt bad for what happened to me and that she thought I was very brave",
  " Brave",
  " Me",
  " Really",
  " As the years passed my personal and home life never got any easier",
  " In fact things got so bad that I ended up having to move to another state, and live with my Aunt due to my mother\u2019s alcohol problem",
  " I once again felt all alone and struggled to fit in with the kids at my church and school",
  " I once again had to deal with many people staring, whispering, and asking me about what happened to my face",
  " Only this time I received compassion not bullying",
  " A few girls from my high school came up to me and asked if I wanted to hangout with them",
  " It was nice to have friends who were compassionate and liked me for who I was on the inside",
  " They eventually asked about the scar on my face, and I told them my story",
  " This is when I really learned how strong and self accepting I had been all this time",
  " It was the reaction, and the comments of my fellow peers that helped me realize that I had learned how to love myself after all the struggles I had faced over the years",
  " My confidence began to grow, and I was finally able to stand with my head held high, and be proud of what I was able to overcome",
  " As my high school years passed and I moved into adulthood I still was faced with people asking me what happened",
  " As usual I would tell them my story and also the challenges I faced with my childhood",
  " I had a lot more courage to talk about the personal inner struggles I faced as a child as well",
  " Over the years I have learned that I could use my story and childhood to help others either know they are not alone, or help them find compassion and understanding for other people&#8217;s situations",
  " I have been offered many opportunities to have plastic surgery to remove the scar, and have what people would call \u201ca normal life\u201d",
  " I seriously\u2028 contemplated having the surgery to relieve myself of the\u2028 burden of always having to explain my life",
  " After many months, and years of contemplating the surgery I decided that I wanted to keep my scar",
  " After all it is apart of me, and truly helped me with who I have become today",
  " I thought about my future, and what would I say to my future children one day",
  " How could I ask them to love themselves, and to be confident in who they are if I wiped away the evidence of my own",
  " I went on to marry my high school sweetheart and give birth to two beautiful children",
  " First a son, and two years later a daughter",
  " As the years passed and my daughter was now around the age of when I was faced with all my struggles an opportunity presented itself",
  " My daughter came home with a signup sheet to join girls on the run",
  " I signed her up thinking okay she wants to learn how to run",
  " It wasn&#8217;t until the program began that I learned that this was much more than a running program",
  " We went through the guide book after every practice, and that is when I realized that many of the topics we were talking about were the exact struggles I faced as a young girl",
  " The program provided me with the opportunity to share my story, and experiences with my daughter",
  " I saw the growth and self confidence she gained in just one season",
  " We both were hooked, and she has enjoyed many seasons of girls on the run",
  " I decided a few years later that I wanted to take my involvement with girls on the run one step further and become a coach",
  " I wanted to make an impact, and help the girls of the next generation",
  " As a coach of 3rd-5th graders I have had the privilege to watch the transformation of the girls from the beginning to the end of each season",
  " In the beginning of the 2016-17 season\u2019s I moved on to coaching the 6th-8th grade Heart and Sole program",
  " As the spring 2017 season began I learned about the struggles the girls were facing at school",
  " I had the challenge of coaching a group of girls that truly didn&#8217;t get along",
  " In fact a few of the girls were the actual bullies to others girls in our group",
  " I knew in that very moment I was not going to allow these girls to continue down this path",
  " I took each lesson and applied it to the situations they were facing at school",
  " I shared my experiences every chance that I had",
  " Some practices were easier than others, but as the season went on I began to see a change",
  " The girls were finally getting along",
  " I checked in with the school to see how my GOTR girls were doing in their school environment",
  " I was happy to find out that many of the girls were hanging out together",
  " They were sitting together during lunch time",
  " They were forming a bond, and working together to change the environment around them",
  " I was instantly filled with tears, and goosebumps",
  " It was not easy for me to share my childhood experiences with them, but this season I realized the true value I had as a coach",
  " I got to see the impact this program brings to these girls lives right before my very eyes",
  " I got to witness the tremendous growth in each girl",
  " As the season ended with our final 5K I could not be more proud to be their coach",
  " As each girl crossed the finish line with smiles on their faces you could see the self confidence they have achieved",
  " My mission continues as I will do everything I can to make sure the girls of this generation never go through another day without knowing their self worth, self confidence, and the footprint they can truly make in this world",

  "Dedication: My mum, Mrs Osowobi",
  "The narrative of a woman&#8217;s value being in her vagina, ability to do homely chores and care to the family is one that has lingered for a long time",
  " As a girl-child, I believed this and was groomed to be womanly, to keep my modesty, to view marriage and family as the hallmark",
  " My view about intrapersonal relationship was narrow and this impacted my self-esteem and how I comported myself with the opposite sex",
  " It was difficult to see myself outside the light of what society expected me to be",
  "For someone who needed to keep her pride and worth, it was a devastating experience to be raped",
  " It was more than rape",
  " I questioned my womanhood and purpose, believing society that I am a damaged good with no value",
  " Living in a society where victims of rape were shamed to silence for the fear of being stigamtized and most unfortunately, the belief that &#8220;no man would want to marry a damaged good",
  "&#8221; I began to see how I failed to keep my value and absorb the rapist of the responsibility of shame",
  "Everything changed the moment I gained courage to inform my mother",
  " I got a re-orientation that my value as a woman is in my voice &#8211; in my ability to inspire, impact and innovate",
  " To inspire other young women to see their strength and capacity, use their stories and voices, and not be limited by gender-roles",
  " To accept our stories and journey in life and be unapologetic about it",
  "She made me realise it is okay not to be conformed to society&#8217;s standards",
  " It is okay to be a rape survivor and not bear the shame &#8211; afterall, someone committed the crime, not me",
  " Gradually, I began to see that my mother was inspiring me to live and impact through my story",

  " They look at me with a quizzical expression, probably wondering where on earth Manafwa is",
  " I let them rack their brains for a while in an attempt to remember where they have heard or seen the word Manafwa before I give them a more elaborate answer",
  " &#8220;Manafwa is the new district just before Bududa",
  "&#8221;&#8220;Oooooh, Bududa",

  "&#8221;&#8220;That\u2019s right",
  "&#8221; I always respond",
  "I have been told by my parents and siblings that I spent the first three or so years of my life in Kampala, but the earliest memories of my life all begin at Manafwa",
  " It is where I have grown up, and where I call home",
  " Growing up, I can hardly say I had dreams or even ever thought of what my life would become in future",
  " To me, life was all about doing what was supposed to be done i",
  "e",
  " go to school, get good grades, be obedient, respectful and everything else; all of which I did",
  " However, when it came to personal goals and ambitions in life, I was headed in no particular direction",
  " Right from a tender age, I was always assaulted with the million dollar question: What do you want to be in the future",
  " Most times, I would smile shyly, look down or sideways, open my big eyes and put on the most innocent face I could until whoever asked forgot their question and concentrated on how sweet and small I looked",
  " Of course there were a few who wouldn\u2019t be easily swayed",
  " So, when it came to such people, I always had three responses to choose from: Teacher, Doctor or Engineer &#8211; in that order",
  " It goes without saying that the prejudiced setting grew up in always looked down on the teaching profession",
  " So why in the world would I want to be a teacher",
  " Well, the answer is pretty simple: Because my father was a teacher, a Deputy Head Teacher in fact",
  " I was always fascinated by the amount of power he seemed to wield over hundreds of students and several other older people simply by virtue of the title he held",
  " My siblings and I were constantly referred to as &#8220;Abaana b\u2019Omusomesa&#8221; (loosely translated to mean &#8220;the teacher\u2019s children&#8221;), and that to me was a \u2018title\u2019 to revel in",
  " Then, why doctor",
  " You may ask",
  " Well, because the only other &#8220;successful&#8221; person in my father&#8217;s family was an uncle who is a medical doctor",
  " I didn&#8217;t know so much about doctoring and medicine but being a doctor sure sounded like a cool thing to me",
  " How about engineering",
  " At that age, I didn&#8217;t know anyone who was an engineer, and had no idea what engineers did or how one became an engineer",
  " However, I always bested my peers in mathematics and everyone would be like, &#8220;You will make a good engineer one day",
  "&#8221; I soon noticed that they seemed to hold engineering in such a high regard",
  " So, I added it to the list of those things I wanted to be/become",
  " When I joined secondary school at Mt",
  " St",
  " Mary&#8217;s Namagunga \u2013 one of the country\u2019s best \u2013 I still hadn\u2019t made up my mind about my dream career",
  " None of the three choices on my list elicited any passion in me",
  " Interestingly, all my classmates (girls my own age) seemed to have everything figured out",
  " I met girls who talked passionately about being aeronautical engineers or architects or lawyers and how that had been their dream since they started primary one",
  " I would stare at them in absolute awe because in my primary one, all I thought about was P",
  "E (physical education), break time and lunch time",
  " In addition to my uncertainties about the future, I had to deal with a myriad of insecurities about myself",
  " Here I was, a tiny short girl coming from a remote village miles away from modern civilization in a school full of girls that had it all",
  " Because I had attended a rural school (that had numerous challenges arising from the poor facilitation that has come to typify most government-aided schools under the pitiable Universal Primary Education program) for the greater part of my primary school, this felt like some kind of blot on my profile",
  " In my new surroundings, it was strange for one to report late to school on account of &#8220;no money&#8221;",
  " In my second term of Form One, I reported to school two weeks late, and I had to lie to everyone that I was sick because no one would have believed that I stayed home because my parents couldn&#8217;t raise the school fees",
  " Then there was the issue of \u2018eats\u2019: whereas my classmates&#8217; trunks were loaded with cartons of milk and splash, boxes of water and cereal, tins of biscuits and the like; all I had were a few home cooked \u2018eats\u2019 that couldn&#8217;t even occupy half of my trunk",
  " I cannot begin to tell of the clothes I painfully wore term after term, all the while wishing I had been born into a richer family so I could also afford new clothes as and when I wished",
  " By Form Three, my self esteem had taken a major hit",
  " I wallowed in self pity day after day and cried night after night about the things I didn&#8217;t have",
  " I had a hard time making friends because I was ashamed of myself",
  " I could have chosen to look at the positives, but instead focused on what others had that I was in lack of",
  " I sank deeper and deeper into this dismal abyss of low self esteem and self pity",
  " However, a chance encounter with Ben Carson\u2019s best-seller Think Big in my Form Four vacation changed my life",
  " I learnt how to look at myself in a more positive way, to ditch the self pity and instead focus on becoming a better person",
  " The first real step towards improving my self esteem occurred when I received my UCE (Uganda Certificate of Education) results",
  " I couldn&#8217;t believe my eyes: I got 9 aggregates in 8 best done subjects",

  "It was a startling discovery five years ago that prompted me as a then 21-year-old girl in Uganda to found Go Girl Africa",
  "My inspiration came from a chance encounter with a young cousin who had been sent away in disgrace when she became pregnant at age 15",
  " At first, I thought the girl was living in the village and being cared for",
  " Instead, here she was, roaming a city street\u2014as a sex worker",
  " When I asked her cousin why she turned to sex worker, the girl simply told me that she had no choice",
  " She had had her child and needed to survive",
  "These shocking circumstances left their permanent mark on my heart",
  " My cousin (let us call her Sophia, for now), is not the only one in this condition",
  " The problem is bigger",
  " Girls, especially in conflict-affected countries like Uganda, are 90% more likely to be out of secondary school due to pregnancy related reasons than their male counterparts",
  "((*1)) Uganda retains one of the highest rates of adolescent pregnancy and early marriage in sub-Saharan Africa",
  " A study by Jain &amp; Kurz (2007: 14) ranked Uganda 9th among the top 20 \u2018hotspot\u2019 countries for child marriage",
  " Teenage pregnancy and early marriage have far reaching negative social and economic consequences at individual, family and national level",
  " Social consequences include early school dropout, lost development opportunities for adolescents and their children and high poverty levels",
  "Unfortunately, significant gaps in most development programming undermine the extent to which society can benefit from girls\u2019 leadership for both peace and equality",
  " While youth includes girls and boys, young women and young men; most youth-oriented peace building policies and programs often target young men",
  " Those that aim to enhance girls\u2019 and women\u2019s participation often fail to include adolescent girls and young women",
  " This leaves girls and women excluded from development efforts, and leads to further marginalization",
  "Needless to say, each year of secondary education for a girl correlates to a 25% increase in wages later in life, so even a slight investment in girls can have a substantial economic impact",
  " Girls and young women have the capacity to be strong partners for peace and security",
  "After my encounter with young Sophia, in 2014, I launched Go Girl Africa (GGA), with one major aim: \u201cto help vulnerable girls create legitimate sources of income that do not place their health and lives at risk",
  "\u201d My work with GGA has earned me a Fellowship with USIP\u2019s ((*2)) Generation Change program, which trains young civic leaders in the Middle East, Africa and beyond with leadership skills and connects them to support each other in their difficult work",
  "I have a mission to inspire positive action among girls and women everywhere to challenge the status quo and be the best they can be",
  " I believe girls and young women have enormous, untapped potentials and can be very effective in instigating positive change in their communities",

  " Success was my goal, my destiny, my calling and I was determined to do what it took to achieve it",

  " Honestly my insecurities had caught up with me, so many doors in my life were shut out",
  " For example, I always asked God for a perfect husband, but never gave him the chance to perfect me first",

  " During that training, we went through a course on 7 habits of highly effective people and I realized that I had been putting myself last",
  " With the job, wifely duties and children, I always have no time left to myself as I have to make sure everything in the house is in order",
  " This unpaid care work combined with professional work was beginning to eat me up and I had no time left for myself",
  " This was not only affecting me but also the people around me because I was then becoming rude even to my children who are just toddlers",
  " My friends had started excluding me from their circles because I was never there every time they called me for events",
  "From \u2018The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People\u2019 which were covered during the aforementioned training, I took note of habit 6 which talked about synergizing that is getting time for fun even when working",

  "  Her sister had sent her the book from California",
  "  My friend said \u201cYOU need to do this program with our girls, YOU could do this, YOU were made to teach this program",
  "\u201d Well after a few more babies and some family challenges along the way, Girls on the Run kept coming up in my life",
  "  Every time I would put it on the back burner it would somehow bubble up to the surface and give me a little nudge",
  "  In 2014 I finally got the courage to take the plunge",
  "  During the process of the monstrous GOTR application \u2013 which totaled 297 pages",
  "  As proposed council director I was asked to answer the question \u201cWhy are you interested in starting a council of Girls on the Run",
  "\u201d WOW",
  " Why did I want to REALLY start a council so badly",
  " I\u2019ve reflected back on my life and all the reasons for wanting to start this council",
  "  I have had several friends over the years say to me \u201cyou are the most confident person I have ever met\u201d and when I think back on my life and try to find the reasons why that may be true I always come back to what I learned about myself through sports",
  "When I was a freshman in high school I tried out for the field hockey team and I remember seeing this older girl, a fiery read head named Susan, she was so amazing and she had this confidence on and off the field that I had never seen before",
  "  It wasn\u2019t until my sophomore year that I became close friends with Sue",
  "  Through that friendship Susan taught me how to celebrate my strengths and abilities instead of downplaying my talents",
  "  I learned from Susan how to embrace my competitive edge and never be afraid to be strong and true to myself",
  " When I starting dating my now husband Don the Summer going in to our Junior year of high school, we challenged each other in every sport imaginable",
  "  Do you know how hard it is to play field hockey one on one",
  " If I had to play another game of RISK one more time I might have strangled myself",
  "  Don never let me off the hook, he still doesn\u2019t, he challenges me and never lets me win",
  "  Don inspires me to be my best and give my best 100% of the time",
  "  If only I could get that laundry thing down",
  "  When I looked back, turns out I had a really hard year in 2002 \u2013 my sister passed away in February from years of substance abuse and my friend Susan (that fiery red head) passed away of ovarian cancer in August that same year",
  "  I really struggled with these two deaths",
  "  I struggled with the two very different extremes of self worth",
  " I remember thinking what are you going to do to make a difference",
  " Did I want to do work with substance abuse",
  "  One of my professors in college said try to be \u201cproactive\u201d in business\u2026 I thought to myself",

  " Why not be proactive in LIFE",

  " GIRLS ON THE RUN is how you REACH those girls\u2026I\u2019ll close with a little story, our daughter is a competitive swimmer, she has been since the age of 7 1/2",
  " When she started competing she would get these belly aches right before her heat, like clock work we would head to the bathroom\u2026 one particular swim meet the conversation went something like \u201cdo you get a little nervous before you are getting ready to race",
  "\u201d and she said \u2013 I remember it like it was yesterday \u201cyes mom, but once I get up on those starting blocks, it all goes away mom and I feel great\u201d 7 \u00bd &#8211; can you believe it",

  "  In fact, running is very far outside my wheelhouse and something I tend to emphasize when people say they can\u2019t coach or join GOTR because they don\u2019t run",
  "  I remind them it\u2019s not about the running, it\u2019s about the lessons learned both in the curriculum and outside of it",
  "  And really, finding inspiration and lessons in the smallest of things is probably, to me, the hallmark of the program",
  "I often joke I\u2019d be less of a jerk if I had a program like GOTR when I was a kid, but like many coaches and volunteers, my life has been impacted by the people I\u2019ve met over the years, none more so than my time as a Sweeper",
  "  For those that don\u2019t know, the sweepers are the very last people to finish in our celebratory 5Ks \u2013 we ohana by making sure no one gets left behind or forgotten on the course",
  "  I\u2019ve been a sweeper for several races now and each time I find the stories from the back of the pack are just as important as those from the front",
  "Last spring, while sweeping with my fellow board member, Donna, we had the chance to meet a GOTR girl and her mom who were competing",
  "  It was her first year in the program and she talked about how much she loved everything, even the laps, during lessons",
  "  After the first mile marker, she started to pick up her pace as the spirit of the 5K infected her and we were left with her mother",
  "  Donna noted that the mother had a heart beat style tattoo that has become popular in recent years and commented that she thought it was lovely",
  "The mother revealed that her daughter had a heart defect that will eventually require a transplant",
  "  The doctors told this mother that her daughter\u2019s life would most likely be limited because of this defect, which she didn\u2019t entirely accept",
  "  When the chance for the daughter to join GOTR came up, she was hesitant but believed in the power of the lessons of the program enough to let the little girl join",
  "  During the race the mother said she was so proud of her daughter for not just completing the program, but completing a 5K \u2013 something no one thought possible of her",
  " She even said she couldn\u2019t wait to call the cardiologist the following Monday to share the exciting news",
  "For most of that 5K, her daughter remained within sight of us as she alternated between walking and jogging with other GOTR girls around her, but as we turned onto the track for the last section of the race, she took off and ran towards the finish line with the energy so natural to elementary school girls",
  "  I watched as a little girl who was told she \u2018couldn\u2019t\u2019 accept a 5K medal with a beaming smile and a mother who was bursting with pride",
  "  The GOTR ripple effect at work",
  "Two years ago, I had experienced my first Sweeper Moment that really began my love affair with being in the back of the pack",
  "  I had never swept before, but I can say after that season, I was hooked",
  "  I got to complete a 5K and enjoy it at a pace more fitting for me than for, say, Wilma Rudolph",
  "  That year as Donna, who has become my Sweeper Pal, and I walked the course, we realized that we were out pacing our very last participant",
  "  Even when we slowed our own paces it still wasn\u2019t enough",
  "The woman, a mother of a girl running that race, was walking incredibly slow, mostly due to her weight and what looked like a limp",
  "  I would later find out that she had surgery on her leg half a year prior",
  "  But her pace, as slow as it was, was consistent and she walked the path with her ear buds in and a bag with water bottles hanging from her wrist",
  "  As Donna and I passed cheer squads and water stations, we told them they absolutely could NOT leave until she passed them",
  "  She was a walker in our race and she was going to experience everything everyone else did before her",
  "Eventually people who were part of the cheer squads and the stops would pass by us on their way back to the race headquarters, while our Super Mom was still walking the course behind us",
  "  About half a mile from the finish line, a young girl came running up to me and Donna",
  "  When I asked her where she was going, it was revealed that this GOTR girl was going back to finish the course with her running buddy \u2013 Super Mom",
  "  I told Donna to go ahead and I would walk back with our GOTR girl so she can catch up to her mom",
  "During the short walk, this girl talked ninety to nothing about how she was so happy her mom was her running buddy and that even with all her health problems, Mom wanted to be there",
  "  She spoke of her mother with such pride and love that when we caught up with Mom, she ran over and gave her mother the biggest hug I\u2019ve ever seen",
  "  As we walked back, members of the last cheer squad joined us",
  "  Super Mom talked to the adults about how she felt it was important to be her daughter\u2019s running buddy and to show her daughter that there is no such thing as limitations",
  "  While she herself had a lot to work through mentally and physically to achieve her goals of being a mom that can play with her daughter, she knew that the first positive step to take was to just do it because she had to prove that anything was possible",
  "  One of the things I told my girls this season was how we see ourselves is much different than how others see us and this is a perfect case",
  "  The mom felt she need to be a better role model for her daughter and all the while the daughter spoke of her mother with such admiration for always being there for her",
  "  Together they finished the race \u2013 so far behind everyone else that the finish line was already packed away \u2013 but they finished to cheering staff and volunteers",
  "  And while we only give girls in the program medals for completing the season, our director was on hand with a medal and tears in her eyes for the mom that embodied GOTR spirit on that chilly November evening",
  "This year, our council had 1,465 girls in the spring and another 750 in the fall of 2016, making this the biggest year yet for us and nearly 2300 girls whose lives are forever changed by a ten-week program",
  "  That means over 2200 families lives touched by girls who are stronger and better than they were",
  "  We just finished our spring season 5Ks and I saw girls who ran like gazelles and girls who walked the whole way holding hands with their newfound friends",
  "  I saw moms cheer their daughters and dads wear tutus, grandparents holding up signs, and coaches who nearly cried watching the girls they\u2019ve mentored this season do something they never thought possible",
  "  I watched as ayoung girl with developmental disabilities walk/jog a mile with her family cheering with pride",
  "  While she never made it past that mile marker sign, she stood beaming with pride next to it while family took pictures",
  "I may be sweeping from the back, but I can see clearly what leads these girls, our coaches, our staff, our volunteers, and our communities",

  "  Julianna was in and out of foster care because her mother was going through rocky times",
  " Her demeanor was unhappy, sullen, introverted",
  "  It was hard to get her to make eye contact at our first few practices, and she certainly wasn\u2019t displaying the kind of joyful, healthy confidence we claim to inspire in our girls",
  "  When it was time to run some laps, Julianna shuffled and said her asthma would prevent her from running",
  "  I checked with the school nurse and learned that there were no physical restrictions on Julianna&#8217;s participation",
  "  At the next practice, after our circle time lesson, I spoke to her privately and invited her to be my \u201cRunning Buddy\u201d that day",
  "  I told her I had a bad hip and that I would be grateful if she could go slowly with me and walk some so I didn\u2019t hurt my hip",
  " We moved along at a reasonable walking clip, and a thin layer of Julianna&#8217;s protective cover began to slowly melt",
  "  Each time she returned to practice, it took a lot of gentle handling and extra encouragement to get Julianna to join our circle, share during reflections, run during lap time",
  "  But we coaches and teammates never gave up on her",
  "  Then about the sixth lesson, I saw her flash a single smile when I high-fived her after she ran a whole lap",
  "It wasn\u2019t long after that Julianna began to challenge herself by increasing her lap goal on her &#8220;Identity Card&#8221;",
  "  Some of the words and pictures she drew on her card began to look sunnier",
  "  I now looked forward to having her as another joyful member of our team at each lesson",
  " At the end of the season, all 950 girls from around the region came together for the celebration 5K",
  " Julianna was back living with her mother, and  she was anxiously waiting for Julianna at the finish line with me",
  " When it seemed like the event should be over, because no more girls were in sight, her mom began to get mouthy",
  " I knew it was worry, masked as anger",
  "  I was on the headset with our course marshal and knew Julianna was still running",
  "  I tried to reassure her mother",
  "  Then she appeared around the last bend with her Running Buddy by her side cheering her on",
  "  She was dead last finishing that 5K",
  "  She was absolutely radiant, and earned the same medal as all the other runners that day",

  "Dedication: Kathy AveryI woke up early on this Saturday morning",
  " It&#8217;s rainy, and the perfect day to sleep in, but I couldn&#8217;t sleep",
  "  It&#8217;s chilly in the house, so I made coffee, wrapped up in a blanket and turned on the fireplace",
  " As I sipped on my coffee, I thought about Mother&#8217;s Day tomorrow",
  " I thought about my own sweet mother, and my dear mother-in-law",
  " I thought about my children, and my precious granddaughters",
  " I thought a lot about mothers who have lost a child, like I have",
  " Then, I thought about the mothers who have given their children up for adoption",
  " I believe they are some of the most selfless and brave mothers",
  "I was privileged to read the personal diary of a 19-year-old mother who gave her child up for adoption",
  " It was 1966, and being an unwed mother was about the worst thing that could happen to you",
  " She already felt ashamed, but after telling her mother she was pregnant, she was made to feel even worse",
  " This was an embarrassment to her family",
  "Her mother took her to the doctor, where it was confirmed she was indeed a few months pregnant",
  " Her mother told the doctor to do &#8216;whatever he needed to do to get rid of it",
  "&#8217; He said there wasn&#8217;t much he could do, but gave her five pills to take, to possibly make her miscarry",
  " She told her mother she would not take the pills, but she was forced to swallow one each morning, as the doctor prescribed",
  " She was horrified",
  " She wondered, &#8220;Why are they trying to kill my baby",
  "&#8221; She felt helpless",
  "When the pills failed to terminate the pregnancy, her mother told her to get in touch with the father of the baby",
  " She had been engaged to him, but he cheated on her, and seeing him was the last thing she wanted to do",
  " When she told him she was pregnant, he asked whose baby it was",
  " She was furious",
  " Later, when his own father told him he had to &#8216;do the right thing&#8217; and marry her, she asked him two questions:She asked, &#8220;Do you believe the baby is yours",
  "&#8221; to which he replied, &#8220;No, not for sure",
  "&#8221; She then asked, &#8220;Do you love me",
  "&#8221; to which he replied, &#8220;No",
  "&#8221;Her answer was, &#8220;Then you can go to hell, because I will not bring a baby into a home where there is no love of a father, and where you won&#8217;t even admit to being its father",
  "&#8221;Now that she was an unwed mother, her own mother went about figuring out how to hide her",
  " All the decisions were made without her consent",
  " She had no say in the matter",
  " They found a Catholic home for unwed mothers and she was sent there to live, in hiding, for the duration of her pregnancy, where she would ultimately give her baby up for adoption",
  "No one was to know she was there, and no one could visit her",
  " They even changed her last name so no one could contact her or find her",
  " It was worse than jail",
  " Even prisoners were allowed visitors",
  "She had to work next door in the hospital&#8217;s kitchen forty hours a week to offset the cost of living in the home",
  " She only received $10 a week to keep",
  " Often, she was sent to work in the hospital nursery, when they were short-handed, which was a cruel irony for someone who was being forced to give her baby up for adoption",
  "Thankfully, she could relax in this home, and be around other women in the same predicament",
  " The priest that was there, Father Joe, was kind to her and never made her feel guilty or ashamed",
  " He showed them unconditional love and support",
  " It was just what these young women needed during such a difficult time",
  "One of the things she spoke about in her diary, was the horrible nightmares that all of these women shared",
  " They would dream about their beautiful, unborn children and their future",
  " These dreams always turned into nightmares when something awful would happen to their child",
  " The tragic ending was always the same",
  " They would think, &#8220;If only I didn&#8217;t give this child away, I could have protected them",
  "&#8221;When the babies were born, they were whisked away while the mothers were still under anesthesia",
  " They would never see their child again",
  " The unbearable pain and guilt never, ever went away",
  " All of the not knowing where they were, or what happened to them, was torture&#8230;This mother was different",
  " She refused any anesthesia or pain medication for fear they would do the same to her",
  " She went through terrible agony just so she could see him",
  " When her son was born, they tried to take him away, but she insisted she be allowed to hold her son",
  " They refused to let her, but she was tenacious",
  " She insisted that she be allowed to hold him and feed him while she was in the hospital",
  " She even named him",
  " His first name began with the same initial as the biological father",
  "  His middle name was Joseph, after Father Joe, who was so kind to her",
  "She planned to have him baptized by Father Joe on the last day she was in the hospital",
  " While she was showering, they came and took her son",
  " She wrote in her diary of the excruciating pain and emotion of having her son ripped away from her without even kissing him goodbye",
  " Father Joe was there, and let her go crazy",
  " She even left scratches and blood on him and he told her that she broke a chair, a vase and a picture of the Virgin Mary, screaming at her that &#8220;she knew how it felt to have her son taken away from her",
  "&#8221; She didn&#8217;t recollect any of it",
  " She was exhausted and defeated",
  " She had never felt so helpless and horrible",
  "Then she was sent home to forget",
  "After she got home, she was deeply depressed",
  " Her friend asked her to come over to her (and her parents) house for dinner",
  " It was the last thing she wanted to do",
  " Somehow her friend convinced her, and that night was the beginning to answered prayers",
  " After a long conversation about all that had happened, her friend&#8217;s parents decided they would adopt her little boy",
  " He was to never know that she was his biological mother, but she was able to see him and visit him",
  "If she couldn&#8217;t raise her son herself, this was certainly the next best thing",
  " It was sweet relief to her soul, and she was grateful",
  "I am thankful for that family who stepped up and adopted that little boy, when two out of three of their daughters were already grown",
  " They gave him a good life and allowed his biological mother to be a part of it, even if he didn&#8217;t know it was her",

  "Dedication: My girl on the run, Jamie",
  "A few years ago, my husband and I were at an event where the speaker challenged us to develop a family motto",
  " He suggested we sit down with our kids and create a simple phrase that embodied our values and spoke to our \u201cfamily brand",
  "\u201d We took this to heart and sat with our girls (then ages 4 and 6), and had a lively discussion about what was important to us, what we believed in, and who we were as a family",
  " After much debate, we settled on our motto: \u201cJohnsons Work Hard",
  "\u201d And over the past several years, we have all taken that motto to heart",
  " We remind each other of this core value when someone is struggling, or tired, or feeling lost",
  " It has been a fantastic tool in our lives",
  " But over the past year, I have been reminded that simply working hard isn\u2019t the end all be all",
  " While this is an important aspect of our family identity, like most things, it must always be taken with a grain of salt and a whole bunch of perspective",
  " When our family relocated to the South Bend area almost two years ago, I was excited to start a dream job, I thought our family was complete, and I rushed through boxes and the babyhood of our third child with effervescence and confidence",
  " In fact, I was moving so fast, that before I knew it, I was forgetting to look around and enjoy all my blessings",
  " I found myself in a job that looked amazing on paper, but didn\u2019t make my heart sing",
  " I was short tempered with my three young children, who were growing up SO fast",
  " I was too busy to take care of my body through good exercise and nutrition, and forget about social/emotional/spiritual care&#8230;",
  "",
  "there was no way I had time for that",
  " Before I knew it, I was swirling in a self-made tornado of expectations&#8230;",
  "all on the premise that this is what it had to be because after all, \u201cJohnsons Work Hard",
  "\u201d And then came Nell",
  " That Christmas, I found out that we were going to be expecting our \u201cbonus\u201d baby #4",
  " To say we were shocked would be an understatement",
  " This wasn\u2019t our plan",
  " How could we manage another baby",
  " Regardless, we prepared to welcome baby Nell",
  " Leading up to her birthday, I went through a process of intense soul searching",
  " I realized that although our family motto might be the right way to do things, I didn\u2019t have the right end game in mind",
  " What was I working so hard for",
  " It took a while, but eventually I came to the realization that I needed to put JOY at the center of my life",
  " So&#8230;",
  "I quit my job",
  " I dedicated myself back to my family",
  " I got ready to welcome our \u201cbonus\u201d baby",
  " Don\u2019t get me wrong, it was scary",
  " It was hard",
  " It was an enormous leap of faith, but what happened next, even I couldn\u2019t have predicted",
  " In August, we welcomed sweet baby Nell",
  " And from the first moment I saw her, I knew that only now was our family complete",
  " I had more patience for my three older kids, even my precocious two-year-old",
  " I went to soccer practices, cooked dinners, and my husband and I even started training for our first half marathon (and trust me, we aren\u2019t runners by a long shot",
  ")",
  " I was still a little skeptical at times, but the JOY had definitely started to seep back into all corners of my life",
  " Then, out of the blue, a friend referred me to a job with a local nonprofit",
  " A few conversations and interviews later, and I was the new development director for Girls on the Run Michiana",
  " I cannot begin to express what even my short time at this organization has meant to me",
  " To be able to work towards a goal of empowering girls in my local community means more to me than words could ever adequately describe",
  " My talented co-workers and our remarkable volunteers inspire me daily and I cannot wait to see my relationships with these people continue to grow and blossom",
  " This work and these relationships have been a critical piece of my JOY seeking journey and I am so blessed to be part of this organization",
  " As a new employee, we all agreed that it would be great for me to see the GOTR program firsthand",
  " I was a little apprehensive when I started coaching this group of 3-5th grade girls, but the weeks have flown by",
  " Every Monday and Wednesday, I find myself entrenched in these incredible life lessons with these creative, fun, kind, hopeful girls",
  " They have touched me",
  " Volunteering means to give of your time, but in my case, these girls have given me much more than I could ever give them",
  " As we all learn and grow as a GOTR team, they both give and receive JOY so freely",
  " You can\u2019t help but breathe it in",
  " As luck would have it, my 3rd grade daughter\u2019s school was starting a GOTR program this year",
  " It has been wonderful to talk with her about the lesson we experience each week",
  " I see the lessons of being a GOTR girl impacting my daughter already&#8230;",
  "and it doesn\u2019t hurt that I feel like it has given us a common language to discuss issues we face in our day to day life and issues I know we may face down the road",
  " We are both looking forward to running in the 5K Celebration and I know that this experience will not only change both of us for the better, but also provide memories that we will forever cherish",
  " To be able to share in this growth and JOY with my oldest has been such a gift",
  " So while our family motto is still \u201cJohnsons Work Hard,\u201d we are now a little bit more careful to clarify what exactly we are working towards",
  " For me, it\u2019s JOY",
  " Trying to soak in these fleeting moments with our young family",
  " Taking care of myself physically and emotionally",
  " Giving back to others first, only to then receive later",
  " While putting JOY at the center of things has taken a lot of faith and intentionality on my end, Girls on the Run has come into my life and been a force for JOY that I could never have expected",
  " I am honored to be a GOTR employee",
  " I am proud to be a GOTR coach",
  " And I am blessed to be a GOTR parent",
  " In the spirit of the start of spring and new beginnings, I wish for JOY to become the center of your life",
  " See the good, be the good, chase the good",
  " I promise you won\u2019t be disappointed",

  "I share my story from my bed as I recover from Chemo #10",
  "I was diagnosed in November 2016 with Classic Hodgkins Lymphoma Stage 3 after noticing a lump around my neck",
  " I got an ultrasound which revealed abnormal lymph nodes and a chest CT revealed an 8cm tumor in the center of my chest pressing into my right lung",
  " I was devastated at this news after my biopsy",
  " There were so many people praying for a good report but this is what the Lord had allowed for me",
  " And He gave me the courage and strength to go forward with the decision to get the proper treatment- Chemo",
  "The thought of how sick the Chemo would make me and losing my hair was probably my worst thoughts",
  " But I went into this journey with a positive attitude",
  " After all I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% of how I respond to it",
  " I started treatment in January 2017",
  " My most resent PET scan shows that the tumor has gone down significantly and the chemo is working",
  " Along with everyone&#8217;s prayers and my faith that God is my Healer",
  " I will be done in June and I have been very open about my story",
  " I haven&#8217;t had to stop working",
  " I still can play with my son who will soon be 3 years old",
  " The only days I&#8217;m not well is the day of chemo and the day after",
  " I am blessed beyond measure",
  " I hope that this can be of inspiration to many and I am willing to answer any questions you may have",
  " One thing is for sure",
  " God has not called us to be afraid",
  " So trust that whatever your diagnosis or situation",
  " He will get you through it",
  "One more thing&#8230;I realize sometimes we have to go through the process of healing",
  " Because it&#8217;s in the process that he&#8217;s reveals to us of things we need to get rid of&#8230;like anger, resentment, unforgiveness, bitterness, etc",
  " I had all those and didn&#8217;t even know until God touched me through this process",
  " All the people praying over me",
  " Made me break down and cry like I&#8217;ve never done before",
  " My faith has increased and I pray that yours will be too",
  " We are conquerors",
  " So claim your Victory in Jesus Name",

  " Era solo al nombrar los centros donde podr\u00eda tener la cirug\u00eda que la palabra c\u00e1ncer era mencionada",
  " Era una palabra de miedo",
  " Ahora entiendo el por qu\u00e9 las personas evitan decirla: para evitar reconocer el temor y el poder que parece ejercer",
  "Cuando era una ni\u00f1a me encantaba sentarme en las piernas de mi madre mientras ella compart\u00eda con sus hermanas en la cocina",

  " No era una hermandad lo que alguna vez hab\u00eda esperado para participar, pero ah\u00ed estaba y durante los siguientes d\u00edas y semanas experiment\u00e9 una clase de unidad en amor y apoyo que me sorprendi\u00f3 y me reconfort\u00f3",

  " The food I received from the pantry was a big help, but it wasn\u2019t enough to get us through the month",

  "When I went to apply for food stamps, I sat in my car for an hour crying before going in",
  " I could not believe that my life had brought me to this point",
  "  It is very humbling as a parent to realize you can\u2019t do something as basic as feed your children without help",
  " I was nervous about what people would think of me",
  "  I was so glad that everything went well at Health and Welfare and I was able to enroll in SNAP",
  " Receiving SNAP meant that we didn\u2019t have to go hungry, though it was very challenging to ensure we were eating healthy and nutritious food",
  "  Cans of chili, packs of frozen burritos and ramen noodles are a lot cheaper than lean meats, fresh vegetables and fruit",
  "What I was not prepared for was how other people would look at me and treat me",
  " At the grocery store when people saw I was paying with SNAP, there were rude comments, eye rolling, whispering, people pointing at my cart\u2014even some hostility from the cashier",
  " I started shopping late at night so I might avoid all those judging people and even considered shopping in another town where no one would know me",
  "Many people think those of us who need food assistance are deadbeats and leeches who don\u2019t want to work and take no personal responsibility",
  " In reality, we are just like everyone else",
  " Many of us have jobs, we have children for whom we want the best, we are trying hard to make ends meet from day to day but sometimes life throws you a curve-ball and you need a helping hand",

  "  I have since left my job with the State of Idaho and returned to the nursing profession and could not be happier",

  " I stand on your shoulders",
  "When I woke up in the morning, the first thing I was conscious of was how much I hated my body",
  " I had to get up, go to the loo and get on the scale immediately",
  " What happened during those few minutes would keep me buoyant for the rest of the day or slam me into the ground face first",
  " If I lost a few 100 grams, I&#8217;d be okay",
  " If my weight was the same or, heaven forbid, slightly more, I would hate my body so much that I just wanted to stop breathing",
  " Literally",
  "This was my truth for longer than I care to remember",
  " I can&#8217;t remember the exact day and date that it started, but it was somewhere during my primary school years",
  " As a young girl there was a lot of pressure to always &#8216;look my best&#8217;",
  " I interpreted &#8216;look my best&#8217; as &#8216;be perfect",
  "&#8217; We also grew up on the era of the &#8216;clean plate club&#8217; &#8211; it was the done thing in those days",
  " Does the following sound familiar",
  " &#8216;You won&#8217;t get up from this table until you&#8217;ve eaten all your food&#8217;, or &#8216;You have to eat everything on your plate before you can have dessert",
  "&#8217; So you ate more than you needed to be rewarded with dessert &#8211; that&#8217;s simply how it worked",
  "I wasn&#8217;t overweight at the time, not by a long shot",
  " But I wasn&#8217;t stick thin like some of the girls I was compared with",
  " Slowly I started feeling worse about my body every day and at some point decided that I had to go on a diet",
  " The war between my body and mind had begun",
  "I had to lose weight urgently",
  " But I also had to eat",
  " And when I ate I felt ashamed for being such a weakling",
  " And I&#8217;d try to stay without food for a day or two or be on some crazy diet",
  " And then I&#8217;d have to eat&#8230;and every time I ate I hated myself",
  "Out of ControlAfter I got married things spun out of control",
  " For the first time I was totally in control of what and how much I ate &#8211; and I discovered a talent for cooking and baking",
  " I gained 40 kilograms (88 pounds) in a year",
  " One single terrible year",
  " The result was that I looked unattractive and at least 20 years older than I was",
  "At night I would dream that I was thin again &#8211; only to wake up inside my horribly fat body",
  " And then I&#8217;d cry&#8230;A few years later a very dear friend gave me a diet that worked for her",
  " The food intake was about 700 calories per day, making it rather difficult to stick to it religiously for weeks on end",
  " However, after about 10 months I&#8217;d lost 30 kilograms",
  " Life was better",
  "The next 15 years can be summed up like this: gained 10 kg&#8217;s, lost 8 kg&#8217;s, gained 10 kg&#8217;s, lost 15 kg&#8217;s, gained 20 kg&#8217;s, lost 15 kg&#8217;s",
  " It didn&#8217;t really matter what I weighed though",
  " With the exception of a few months, I always FELT fat",
  " I hated my body",
  " I hated having hips and buttocks and everything else too \ud83d\ude09 One positive thing that happened during this time is that I started training regularly and it became a habit that would stick",
  "Then I got divorced and everything in my life was upside down",
  " As always I turned to food to feed me emotionally",
  " I quickly gained about 10 kilograms, but then lost it all plus five the next year",
  " I was thinner than I had been for very long",
  " And that&#8217;s when the real struggle started",
  " Every morning would start on the scale",
  " And often my day would end on the scale too",
  " I knew it was compulsive and unbalanced, but I had been in a mindset for years where I equated the &#8220;right&#8221; weight to being loved and accepted (in my head)",
  " Then I lost five more kilograms",
  " I was very thin&#8230;and here&#8217;s the bummer: I still thought I wasn&#8217;t thin enough",
  " When I look at photos of that time now, I remember exactly how I felt",
  " When I see what I looked like, I realise how deep the disconnect was between my mind and my body",
  "During the last two years, some of the kilos slowly crept up again &#8211; seven to be precise",
  " As recently as five or six months ago I still felt that terrible, all-consuming body hate &#8211; as if EVERYTHING in my life would be measured against my body weight",
  " I felt as if career and academic achievements meant nothing and I would always be evaluated according to my weight only",
  " It really is a battle about self-love",
  " Mind ShiftI don&#8217;t know what brought about the change &#8211; maybe it was the culmination of a concerted effort to learn to love and accept myself as I am",
  " During these months I made a decision to push the &#8220;reset&#8221; button",
  " I just didn&#8217;t know how or when or who my guide would be",
  "On 31 March 2017, I had a chance encounter with the person that would become that guide",
  " The thin threads that connected me to that spot on that day at that specific time&#8230; well that&#8217;s a story for another day",
  " I decided that I&#8217;d like to share the story of my body journey with you all, believing that someone will be inspired, be motivated and get new hope",
  " It also gives me the opportunity to publicly pay tribute to those who helped me",

  "  House of Pizza Donated 5 giant pizzas,  Save A Lot gave us 100 bags of chips, Jewel in Dyer, In gave us apples, bananas and water, Service Sanitation in Gary discounted a porta potty,  We even got a local printing company Advantage Signs and Printing in Hammond to print and donate all of our girls shirts for our community project, that listed all of our sponsors",

  "Life is always surprising and, although we know that it is, we are always flabbergasted by the vagaries of events",

  "\u00a0 I didn\u2019t have children but I had a successful career that was on its way to an international level",
  "The illness led to the expected operation and the usual treatments, but the cancer was caught in time, and fortunately, because I followed all the guidelines, my life was never really in danger",
  "Instead, what changed after the cancer was me",
  "\u00a0 This isn\u2019t an unusual situation",
  "\u00a0 It happens to many",
  " \u00a0Illness makes you look at things from a different perspective, and this different vision can be a harbinger of a renewed life energy",
  "\u00a0 The women that I have met with the same story all seem brighter, more aware, more resolved",
  "My job perspective changed a bit too",
  "\u00a0 It was no longer so much about a career that would take me to the summit of a huge company, but more about the possibility of working in the same world to help others, being able in that way to give back some of the good fortune that I have had",
  "I, who thought I was so skillful in my financial career, discovered I was an excellent teacher and an empathetic speaker",
  "\u00a0 I found out that my ability as a communicator was much better than I\u00a0 had thought",
  "\u00a0 I received all kinds of appreciation and plaudits for my ability to engage people, and found I could tell a story much better than I ever would have done to present a good budget or financial analysis",
  "It was as if I had \u201cexpanded\u201d and had jumped on the highest step, and I had experiences thanks to the cancer that I never would have had, even things that before I would have considered extraordinary",
  "\u00a0 For example, to lecture at a university before hundreds of people, to discuss my experience with the wife of the then President of the United States, to work on the creation of an organization that supports the empowerment of women in the workplace, to be part of institutional working groups with important people in my country, and to have so many other fantastic experiences that would not even have been thinkable before",
  "Certainly, I still think that it would have been better if I have not become ill, but I also believe that it gave me a greater opportunity, and today I certainly feel myself a better person and perhaps even happier",

  "Dedication: This story is dedicated to all of the go-getter girls in the world on missions to write some of the greatest stories ever written",
  "A go-getter girl is on a mission to write one of the greatest stories ever written",
  " She makes life happen for herself, and does not let life happen to her",
  " To be honest with you, I have spent the large majority of my life as a dreamer, but I quickly realized that this style of living was not particularly effective so I made a personal pact with myself that I would change the trajectory by becoming the queen of my own life, and so I did",
  " In 2014, I decided to become a go-getter girl, a girl passionate about achieving her dreams, a girl who respects herself enough to become the heroine of her own life, and ultimately, a girl who makes the first moves to reach her highest potential",
  " I believed in myself, at times when others were not clear about what I yearned to achieve",
  " But, that is who we are as go-getter girls",
  " We believe in our potential so fiercely that we do not seek validation from others",
  " There were two main secrets which have defined my transformation, and I am excited to share them with you",
  "The first secret of a go-getter girl is that she truly believes she will write one of the greatest stories ever written",
  " Call it confidence, an extraordinarily high sense of self-worth, or an intrinsic belief in herself, she is empowered from within",
  " She does not exclusively depend on others for her own happiness, because she knows that she is responsible for creating her own joy",
  " One of the greatest gifts I have given myself is the gift of self-awareness through spending significant amounts of time alone discovering my passions, inner thoughts, and ultimately, personality traits",
  " Far too many girls today do not recognize the depths of their soul because they have never made a conscious effort to understand themselves",
  " I would highly encourage each of you reading to invest time in yourself because as a go-getter girl, you respect yourself enough to invest in yourself",
  " Focus on your strengths, come to terms with your areas of improvement, and ultimately, fall in love with yourself because you are powerful",
  " Second, a go-getter girl puts herself first in order to be of service and value to others",
  " I have always been comfortable putting myself first in order to serve others because I strongly believe that I am unable to serve others if I am not in a position to serve them",
  " Without an education, inner empowerment, and blazing confidence, a woman is not in a position to serve the world to the highest of her abilities, and so, she must first invest in herself in order to be a woman of substance who can then turn around and give back to the society around her",
  " This particular point generated a great deal of interest on The Huffington Post from women all over the world who felt comfortable to proclaim their desire to put themselves first, which was supremely fulfilling",
  " So, yes, go-getter girls, please build yourselves up in order to be in positions to give back effectively",
  "Today, my life looks very different than it did two years ago, because I consciously focused on becoming the queen of my own life",

  " Or they dismissed my final calls for help as attention seeking \u2013 as the actions of a crazy person",
  " That is what broke my heart the most",
  "But something amazing also happened when I first opened myself to help",
  " People stood strong in support",
  " People I had damaged relationships with, people who I barely spoke to, and friends who cried to me that they were so, so happy that I finally opened my eyes",

  " Exactly how I will get there, only time will show",
  "\u201d I had always felt I was different, not in a way that made me feel superior to other people but in a way that made me feel responsible for every person in my community, the girls especially",

  " I knew though this should not be normal and I needed to do something about this",
  " At age 7, we moved out of this community and have since lived in 2 typical Ga communities",

  " But I turned out different because it was only through being different that I could cause the change I dreamt of",
  "For my basic education, my parents enrolled me in an expensive private school \u2013 too expensive, as compared to their monthly earnings",

  " I have, through Curious Minds, used radio to create awareness and initiated dialogues on issues that many Ghanaians would not want to talk about, even though life-threatening; unsafe abortion, teenage pregnancy, maternal mortality, child marriage, and so on",

  "Three years ago, my skin broke with, in my eyes, severe adult acne",
  " I was devastated to say the least",
  " My self-esteem and self confidence entirely depleted as everyday I looked in the mirror and saw an ugly face",
  " My skin was sore, it was full of pimples and it embarrassed me",
  " At this time in my life I was going through a lot of stress which is probably the reason why my skin broke out, because it was trying to SHOW me I needed a break, I needed to be kind to myself",
  " Our bodies seem to work in mysterious ways but they are truly upfront with telling us what we need we just have to listen to them",
  " So I was broken, I felt ugly and I was about to give up, until I decided I needed to do this, I had to get through this crisis I saw happening in my life",
  " Also at the time I was slowly but surely finding myself on a path to a more holistic and alternative lifestyle of natural health",
  " I decided I would only use natural methods to heal my skin",
  " Little did I know that this decision would take me on a three year journey of not only healing my skin condition but also healing myself through the inside out",
  " I shared my story a few months later on social media in hopes that other suffering from something themselves would feel better about their struggles",
  " I decided I needed to open up about my acne because it was consuming my thoughts",
  " I knew if I was able to confront my acne in a public way I would be able to accept myself for who I am and not worrying about hiding anymore",
  " I decided I wouldn&#8217;t wear any coverup on my skin, not only because it is not healthy for the skin in the healing process but also because I would be covering myself up from what I was truly experiencing and allow myself to hide from it",
  " When I opened up to my friends and family I got nothing but support back from them and through their love and support I was able to grow and embrace their love and kindness",
  " It took many trials and tribulations to get to where I am today",
  " My skin is much more clear then it was three years ago, I no longer suffer from low self esteem on a continued basis but do have my days of low self confidence",
  " I found out that my acne became a blessing in disguise",
  " I learned so much about the strength I had inside of me and my ability to love myself no matter the circumstance",
  " What truly healed my skin was not a cream, or a magic potion, although I did have a lot of help from essential oils, what truly healed my acne was my mindset",
  " Whenever I was negative, put myself down and had bad thoughts in my head, my skin would become inflamed, red and my acne would be worse",
  " Whenever I was really happy, excited, experiencing love and kindness my acne would get better",
  " Once I changed the way I was thinking, my acne and my life started to change",
  " ONE YEAR AGO is when I started making that change, I&#8217;ve come so far in the last 3",
  "5 years and I still have a lot of growing to do as a person, but it is possible",
  " I&#8217;ve learned that getting to your final goal or destination isn&#8217;t really the prize, or the most satisfactory because if you only look towards the future and don&#8217;t think about the present you&#8217;ll never truly know when you reach your destination",

  "In my community, being a girl is like putting together a really difficult puzzle",
  " Being a girl can often mean that the different pieces of you don\u2019t quite fit together",
  " You should not be well-educated, and your place is in the kitchen",
  " You should learn to take care of your husband and children, but at the same a girl can be a child herself when she becomes a bride",
  " She shouldn\u2019t be confident enough to questions issues, make choices, and explore her potential, but must be strong enough to carry these burdens",
  " This makes it difficult to be a girl in my community",
  "I broke through this painful reality to become a women\u2019s rights activist",
  " I didn\u2019t want to see even one more girl go through this process of trying to fit these jagged pieces together",
  " For many girls, this can feel like imprisonment, where their voices are silenced and their rights are violated",
  " This drives me to support these girls and women to live a worthwhile life that they love",
  "My zeal to talk loudly about reproductive health was born when I witnessed a girl die helplessly due to unsafe abortion",
  " She didn\u2019t have access to information or resources about how to prevent pregnancy in the first place, and she also lacked choices when it came to accessing reproductive health options, including safe abortion services",
  " As a girl growing up in a rural community, I never had resources or power to help out my peers",
  " This meant I witnessed a lot of suffering",
  " All the same, I realized eventually that my voice is a very powerful tool that I can use to help girls in my community, and that drove me to action",
  "In my community, a super woman and decent girl is one who dies in silence and let others make decisions for her",
  " I have seen situations where a pregnant woman in labor cannot be allowed to rush to the health facility because the husband is still yet to give consent",
  " This usually means they end up in a grave",
  " I am talking of a community where a normal biological process such as menstruation can shatter a girl\u2019s future; sometimes it means she misses school because there are no facilities; sometimes it means she must trade sex for pads, which can lead to teenage pregnancy, unsafe abortion, or HIV/AIDS",
  " People in my community pretend not to know that just like girls need books, school uniforms, and pens, they need sanitary towels and supplies",
  " This is still a dream in my community",
  "At the decision-making table, where resources are allocated, young women and adolescent girls are not welcome",
  " Their voices are never heard nor do their perspectives count, even though the outcome affects them the most adversely",
  " Even though there is legislation in the Kenyan parliament right now that would help to address gender inequality in all its forms, the male-dominated parliament ensures that this dream of equality is yet to become a reality",
  "These are just few of major challenges women go through in my community",
  " However this doesn&#8217;t mean that things cannot change",
  " I am a believer in lasting change, and I strongly believe that if efforts, investments, and good will are all put towards women and girls in my community things will change for a brighter economy and society",
  " This will come true if we engage at different levels, and if everyone does a small part",
  " When a few people come together and use their voices in support of women and girls, we become one very loud collective voice that nobody can ignore",
  "Girls and women are the drivers of development and powerful agent of change in our communities",
  " They not only deliver for themselves if enabled, but for the families, communities, and societies",
  " If their opportunities are taken away because they are married early or face an unplanned pregnancy, or because they can\u2019t go to school when they have their period, the entire world suffers the consequences",
  " Women have the power to deliver babies and make world beautiful, but we can\u2019t do that if the pieces fall apart during our adolescence",

  "1961-July 2016Early in my childhood, my parents separated and eventually got divorced",
  " My sister and I went to live with our grandmother in rural Jamaica",
  " We lived in a farming community called James Hill, down a rocky road at the foot of a hill called \u201cSinking Bottom",
  "\u201dFor years we couldn\u2019t afford modern amenities like electricity and television, and I studied with a kerosene lamp",
  " We used an outside pit latrine and water supply was from neighboring springs or rain water",
  "My parents tried very hard to provide for us, even though they were separated and each only had secondary education",
  " My mother got pregnant as a teenager and became a domestic helper",
  " My dad did several jobs at various times, including farming",
  " Despite their hard work, it was still really hard financially",
  "There were days I walked miles to and from high school, which was miles away in the neighboring community",
  " There were days when I sold coconuts in the village and snacks on the school bus in order to make money for school fees",
  " Despite this hardship, I was determined to complete high school",
  "As a teen, I felt the devastating effects of physical and sexual abuse",
  " Looking back, it feels like my teen years aligned with my home at Sinking Bottom",
  " Eventually I sank further into low self-esteem, marijuana use, feelings of rejection and depression and attempted suicide",
  "Yet, I was determined to break the cycle of poverty in my family, and rise from the sinking bottom",
  " I was determined to rise",
  " I determined I was going to have University education",
  "Throughout my life, my grandmother bestowed her decades of wisdom, courage and strength on us, and inspired me to dream big",
  " She inspired me to believe in my unseen potential and to have unwavering faith in God",

  "When I was 15 years old, I joined Youth for Youth, a Romanian non-governmental organization working on youth sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR)",
  " I became a volunteer and a peer educator, and I went into the role with very little knowledge about what SRHR even meant",
  " My awareness, self-confidence, and dedication grew with every new volunteer I met, every workshop and training I attended, every outreach activity and session I delivered in high schools, and every young person with a question I could answer",
  "It was challenging to be a peer educator on SRHR at that young age",
  " My parents, friends and the community around me were casting their protective shield, making it clear to me that they wanted me to prioritize high school studies",
  " \u201cYou must make sure that preparing for university admission is your main focus,\u201d they all said to me",
  "Being a volunteer was something rather new for our generation, and so were civic education, youth rights and the concept of participation",
  " For that reason most of our parents had little knowledge and understanding of why this was important to me and my peers, as participation had political and negative connotations and sex and sexuality were generally a taboo",
  " But I was lucky to have my parent\u2019s trust and support",
  " They played an instrumental role in allowing me to explore, to develop my analytical thinking and leadership skills, to follow the paths I thought were right, and to learn from my own mistakes",
  "My high school principal and teachers saw my interest in being engaged in different projects and extracurricular activities, my devotion to this cause, and my accomplishments, and they have guided and supported me to pursue my aspirations",
  " When I was 19 years old, I was allowed and encouraged by my parents and teachers to undertake a 3 month youth fellowship in the Peer Education Training and Research Institute in Sofia, Bulgaria",
  " I truly believe this was a key milestone and the tipping point in my activism, as the experience and the people I met then shaped my life and who I am today",
  "When I was young, some of my parent\u2019s friends and some teachers thought I was wasting my time with volunteering instead of studying and said this wouldn\u2019t bring any contribution to building a career path",
  " They advised me and my parents to reconsider my decisions",
  " There still are people who think this and who would not allow their daughters to do the things I did",
  "Having a supportive environment, one that includes not only your parents, your family members, your teachers and friends, but also the entire community can be life-changing",
  " It can allow girls and young women to pursue their potential, while its absence can hinder their aspirations",
  " And this has a cascading effect on the society and its growth and development",
  "I see how Romania and the Eastern European region have undergone major transformations when it comes to the concept of volunteering, leadership, and participation",
  " The opportunities for young women and girls to be developing analytical and soft skills, for developing effective interpersonal relationships, for nurturing leadership skills, and enabling them to exercise their rights must continue growing",
  " These opportunities must be inclusive of young women and girls in all their diversity",
  "As I look back and as I look forward, trust and support remain the key words",
  " This means trust and support from those around us and from within ourselves, as we must believe in our own strength and be driven by our inner voice",

  " Most of the time, I often considered myself a coward for the decisions I made",
  " Many of the decisions I made as a young woman meant being cautious and taking preventive measures to avoid the social, economic and cultural issues that affected women in my society",
  "We were taught in school that conflict is natural but violence is not",
  " Violence against women and girls in my community seemed natural, commonplace, normal",
  " I witnessed friends and women in my extended family experience violence, including economic violence, and suffer the consequence of this violence, and I watched it affect their social, mental, and physical well-being",
  " Others struggled with low self-esteem, poverty, disabilities, or mental health complications related to the violence they experienced",
  "This is why I chose to play an active role in my community to support women and girls by working towards violence prevention",
  " I did this by taking the bull by its horns",
  " I worked with children, youth groups and adults alike, championing human rights, social justice and gender equality in my community and later in broader society",
  " I made friends and enemies alike but the message was clear",
  " I was a force to reckon with, a girl who had grown into a young woman in a not so supportive society who wanted the world to be different for other girls",
  "My passion, courage, and commitment to improve the situation of the most vulnerable members of our society &#8212; women and girls &#8212; catapulted me to the international platform",
  " The opportunity to represent my country in international policy forums and taking up leadership roles in regional and international youth networks and organizations afforded me the opportunity to influence young change makers and global leaders",
  " Over the years, I have seen more young women &#8212; from Kenya to Rwanda, Madagascar to India &#8212; take up leadership roles and join in the spirit of championing a violence free society for women and girls",
  "Today, I am proud to have founded an organization that champions sustainable peace and promote violence prevention among youth in local communities",

  "I first uncovered the inequalities and challenges that girls face at a very young age",
  " When I was a girl, I loved basketball",
  " It made me feel free, fast, strong, and in control of my own power and body when I played",
  " But I learned really quickly what gender inequality means and how girls experience challenges that boys simply don\u2019t",
  " I was judged and told that playing sports was not something that girls do",
  " I was told that it wasn\u2019t \u201clady-like\u201d and that nice girls are sweet instead of athletic",
  " But I played basketball anyways",
  " Because I was doing something that \u201conly boys should and could accomplish,\u201d it made me feel both exceptional and powerful but also rejected and discouraged",
  "As an adolescent girl growing up in post-war Georgia, I continued to uncover inequalities",
  " Boys were considered intelligent and strong, and girls were cute and possessed an inherently \u201cinferior intellect",
  "\u201d Girls were supposed to stay home while boys were allowed to have fun",
  " Girls were told to keep their virginity for boys and boys could do anything they wanted",
  "It seemed like the inequalities for girls were abundant no matter where I looked",
  " I started to realize that something was wrong, that there was a power trying to keep me down and that didn\u2019t want me to be confident and strong",
  "As a young woman, I saw many girls around me forced into marriage and deprived of education",
  " Other girls felt the social and cultural pressure to have children and become caregivers, usually without having any knowledge of how to control their own fertility",
  " I talked to young girls in my community about the taboos, lack of education, and stigma around sex, sexuality, and unintended pregnancies",
  " I was not able to close my eyes on the issues that surrounded me",
  " On the contrary, I wanted everyone to know that girls are strong and have limitless power",
  " It was simply unacceptable to me that girls were prevented from living out their full potential",
  "This is not only my story, but a story familiar to many women, both in Georgia and around the world",
  " I became a young advocate because there was an innate discomfort with these apparent inequalities",
  " I was empowered and hurt why many young girls are not given the opportunities to find their power, exercise equal rights, and most importantly, voice and express their needs and aspirations",
  "Through the years of overcoming the multiple barriers and fighting for young people\u2019s sexual and reproductive rights and social justice, I realized I am fortunate to grow up with family and friends who taught me that I should believe in myself",
  " They didn&#8217;t expect me to adhere to social norms",
  " Despite being raised during war, my parents provided access to the best education available, while, most importantly, inspiring me to be who I am",
  " For many young girls and women around the world, there is no option for school and these rights are non-existent",
  "I want to change that, and I work every day to do so",
  "This is why I am dedicated to fight the inequalities and continue to work to provide opportunities that give girls and women the platform to realize their true potential",
  " There is no price that can be put on the empowerment of girls and women",
  " This is why I played basketball anyway, and why I talked to girls about sex even when it was taboo",
  " This is why I went on to become a doctor, and why I run marathons today",
  " When girls challenge the limited opportunities that are presented to them and strive for something bigger, they are shattering the norms that keep them down",
  "I am always inspired by other women and I am dedicated to dismantling structures that make girls feel powerless and worthless",
  " The voices of girls must be heard, and girls should be given opportunities to learn and uncover their excellence and the exceptional qualities they bring to the world",
  " I believe that empowered girls are central to equality and peace, and the only way that girls can make change is if they can access their limitless potential",

  "During the three decades I have lived as a woman, I have experienced, felt, and witnessed many discriminatory practices, especially harmful traditional practices such as female genital mutilation and child/forced marriage against women and girls in my community",
  " In most instances, the victims of such discriminations have little or no power to end the injustices they face",
  " This situation is the sad reality for many, just because they are a girl or woman in such environments",
  "I am a thirty year old woman who decided to question such inequalities, and am still demanding change in my community against these cultural practices and patriarchal norms that undermine the rights, freedoms and integrity of women and girls",
  "This journey, I must confess, started at a time when I didn&#8217;t fully understand what these harmful practices were in the first place",
  " I couldn&#8217;t even categorise them as harmful but felt that something is just wrong with denying girls and young women from enjoying the right to their bodily integrity",
  " It is patriarchal norms that allow for women to be sexually controlled and pinned to the needs of men and boys",
  " I also couldn&#8217;t understand how girls can be pulled out of school to be married off to relatives, neighbours and even strangers",
  " At that young age, I was convinced that any man who forces a girl to marry him is not a good man, regardless of who he is",
  "Religious reasons, health benefits, social cohesion, virtuousness and cleansing of women and girls are some of the reasons put forward by the proponents of female genital mutilation",
  " For child marriage, it is usually justified with the prevention of teenage pregnancy or &#8220;dishonour&#8221; caused by it, and poverty, among others",
  " All these justifications are backed by gender inequality and the exploitation of girls",
  " In a society where social security mostly rests on the extended family system, women and girls become economic tools for the social stability of their families",
  " This is not only wrong but terrifying for any girl to live through",
  "From a very conservative ethnic group, I was socialised to believe that FGM, like other traditional practices are in the best interest of women and girls",
  " The consequences of the practice became very obvious to me when I started teaching myself about the inequalities girls of my tribe face in their daily lives",
  " Illiteracy and unemployment put us all vulnerable to economic deprivation, dependency and a vicious cycle of poverty",
  " I wanted to break this ritual to become an educated girl who will make things happen for my mother and other women in a community that continuously deprive them from achieving greatness or even when they do so, their recognition often is attached to the men in their lives",
  "Being the first girl to attain university education in my paternal extended family, I thought I deserved great respect and admiration",
  " I wanted to serve as a role model to girls to attain education and build livelihood skills to live productive and independent lives",
  " My expectation to be an exemplary young woman turned into a nightmare when I narrowly escaped a forced marriage",
  " At the age of twenty-five, I couldn&#8217;t imagine that a marriage was being arranged on my behalf without my consent",
  " I declined the proposal based on the reason that I will decide how I live my life by choosing my own partner without any form of coercion",
  "Through this experience, in addition to the scars I carried from FGM, I felt even more compelled to do so something for the many girls in my community who can&#8217;t protect themselves from such violence",
  " Despite all the odds, I believe in myself",
  " I knew I can be the voice to demand for equality, freedom and social justice for the oppressed and marginalized",
  " I set myself on a personal journey to change this situation",
  "Turning the prevalence rates of FGM from 77% to 0% and child marriage from 36% to 0% has become a life commitment",
  " The reality is this is such a giant goal and a vision that is overwhelmingly complex, yet with commitment, I am convinced that it is attainable",
  " I don&#8217;t have all the answers, neither do I understand all the complexities that hitch my ambition to end FGM but my devotion is deep",
  " Although gender-friendly laws and policies are required in order to fully address gender-based violence, I am conscious that a social change movement must be the bedrock for any meaningful change to attain for women and girls",
  " With few friends, I had an idea to create an initiative that will contribute to this movement",
  "In 2011, I co-founded The Girls&#8217; Agenda, an organization led by young women in my community to address several issues that undermine the progress of young women and adolescent girls",
  " Through this organization, I educate, campaign, lobby and demand for the respect and protection of the sexual and reproductive health rights of girls and young women by addressing child marriage and FGM among others",
  "My best strengths lie in my social mobilization skills and ability to initiate community friendly initiatives to educate my people about the human rights violations and consequences of child marriage and FGM and how we can work together to uphold the rights of every young woman and girl",
  " Through this work, I am transforming lives",
  "Working with local politicians, religious leaders and institutions, custodians of tradition, parents and guardians, I have been able to initiate discussions regarding sex, sexuality; openly talked about the clitoris, vagina and penis and other reproductive health right matters with very conservative and sometimes difficult populations",
  " Surely, these sessions were sometimes hard to manage but the necessity to penetrate these individuals and or their institutions will enable me to achieve any meaningful progress for my beneficiaries",
  "In addition, I also lead activities that exclusively target young people",
  " To end FGM, child marriage, honour killing or virginity testing in my generation, it will be through the voices and actions of young people",
  " It definitely will be through the initiatives we lead to create change for girls and women to thrive",
  " Seminars with young researchers and academics, conferences with young people, exclusive summer camps for girls and trainings for young people going to religious institutions, experience sharing/story telling sessions with teenage mothers and survivors of FGM are some of the activities I lead",
  "These initiatives are empowering because these young people are able to openly talk about sex through comprehensive sexuality education modules and make choices about their bodies",
  " The programs are also reassuring for a brighter future in the women&#8217;s rights movement because girls can openly discuss and suggest solutions to their own problems",
  "These efforts have turned me into a young leader conscious of my rights and those of my peers as we tirelessly work to ensure these rights are respected and protected",
  " This has enabled me to become a change agent by mobilizing young people to lead this process",
  " We are gaining grounds by breaking the most difficult barriers, glass ceilings and stereotypes that draw us back",
  " It is possible for every young woman or girl to be a leader of transformation, a voice for the voiceless and a beacon for a free society where women and girls&#8217; human rights will be protected and guaranteed",

  "I started my work as a volunteer and I still volunteer",
  " Late at night, in the weekends, travelling in and out of my city alone for 10 hours for both work and volunteer work, sometimes I get to travel in groups and that is much more fun and safe",
  " As a feminist activist, I work hard to break barriers and voice my frustration over rights violations, inequality, injustice and challenge the sexist system",
  " BUT this story is not about that",
  " This is a story about all my feminist friends, mostly young women",
  "Many of my friends studied the same degree with me, and we started volunteering with a lot of motivation and passion",
  " We were determined to make a difference, but lost the opportunity as a result of a range of discriminatory cultural norms and values",
  " They were not allowed to travel freely, associate with boys, work too late, talk about sexuality, talk about equality, and challenge the norms",
  "They were challenged, demotivated, and stopped by their parents, boyfriends, brothers, neighbors, relations and some even by social media trolls",
  " I succeeded mainly because I received support throughout from my parents and my mentors",
  " They believed in me even when others didn\u2019t",
  "They strengthened me to fight trolls",
  "They guided me well and stood up for me",
  " I am truly grateful to have met the right mentors who shared their expertise, experience and stories with me to make me strong",
  "I would suggest and request kindly from all feminists and veterans in the field to help younger feminists",
  " Support them",
  " Lift them up and share your experience with them",
  " It is critical for younger feminists to respect and acknowledge the older generations and vice versa for their contribution, creativity and capacities",
  " Intergenerational work is truly important to build a movement and strengthen existing movements",
  "Now I see a greater sense of acceptance and admiration for my work in the country than when I started",
  " People have seen the transformation our work can create and have started believing in them",
  " I now easily talk about very taboo topics like sexual violence, abortion or sexuality education on national TV and in policy-making fora where I am accepted as a value addition to their conversations",
  "Sharing from my experience I would like to say that young women should be able to challenge the society, social norms, and the status quo",
  " Challenge the structures",
  " Challenge people who challenge you",
  " Keep doing what you do and one day people will see what you mean and realize the impact you are making",

  "I believe that every woman is powerful, and just needs to explore her inner strengths",
  " This is a story of an ordinary woman who opened her eyes in the very normal middle class family, where no women was allowed to seek/find and or explore her abilities to challenge the family norms and traditions against women",
  "I first recognized my inner strength at age 13 when I started my social activism",
  " I wanted to challenge the inhumane behaviors of men of the family against women and girls, many who were being forced to kill their dreams and desires on the name of family honor",
  " These women had no say in the family matters",
  " They didn\u2019t have permission to decide things for themselves, or and make decision regarding their own education, employment, marriage or sexuality",
  " The men of the family decided everything for them",
  "When she was just 15, one of my female cousins was forced to marry a man three times her age",
  " Her voice wasn\u2019t heard by members of my family even when she tried to resist",
  " Yet all of the women of the family were silent",
  "I knew I had to do something",
  "This terrible incident broke something within me but also made me feel empowered enough to talk to my mom and other women of the family",
  " I tried to convince them to speak against this terrible thing that was happening to my cousin but she asked me to stop and bear everything silently and accept it as a tradition of our family",
  "Few days later, i had to face the similar situation, which I refused to accept and my whole family started blaming my mother for this as till that time we were only four sisters, and on every single thing my mother had to bear the blame for only producing girls",
  " We had nowhere to turn, and I finally convinced mother to take action",
  " She took my sisters and me away, rented a house and started working as domestic worker to feed us",
  " I admire her for her strength and courage, and this changed me, showing me that every woman is powerful enough to speak out against injustice",
  "In 2004, I started a theater group called Chanan Theater Group (now called Chanan Development Association), a national youth-led organization to raise awareness and educate women and girls about their basic and fundamental rights in my community",
  " My group become the part of a national civil society campaign against Hadood Laws and other discriminatory laws against women in Pakistan",
  " Through this campaign, we reached over 300,000 women, girls, and youth to raise awareness about these laws against women and to encourage them to become the agents of change within their families and communities to stop them",
  "Many people are inspired by this idea of using theater to raise awareness on such issues to stop violence and discrimination against women and girls",
  " Many women become activists against child and forced marriages, and even saved many lives by spreading the messages about women\u2019s rights, girls education, right to employment, etc",
  "Until August 2009, I had no ability to express myself in the general public other than theater",
  " That was how I found my voice, but there were limits for me",
  " I wanted to find power within me to explore my own abilities and passion to take my vision even further",
  "In 2009, I attended the International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific (ICAAP) in Bali, Indonesia",
  " I was there for more than 10 days, and I barely spoke a single word in front of other people because I felt low and incapable to speak in front of public, and especially in English",
  " I was also keeping myself away from the public and wasn\u2019t able to grab opportunities to grow in the development field, I never applied for any event because I always thought that I might not be able to express me and my work in English Language as I never went to formal school due to financial constraints and did all my studies as private candidate",
  "But while coming back home, I realized that there were so many people like me who have had similar experiences and are doing the same type of work",
  " If they can communicate, speak and express themselves then why not me",
  " It was the movement of my life when I decided to seek my inner abilities and find myself to not only express things for me but for others as well",

  " I get to learn all the time; I have the most open-minded and smart colleagues; and with every single project I have the opportunity to obtain such a wonderful intellectual and personal experience",
  "I focused my work on negotiating with decision makers in order to have better public policies, for this I have to do a lot of research on certain topics, attend meetings with colleagues and key targets and sometimes I get the chance to hold workshops to promote new leaderships within young people",

  "In recent weeks I have had the good fortune of meeting many new people and have become aware of how I answer their questions about me and about my life",
  "  I have also realized that some responses are automatic, like clicking the \u201cplay\u201d button for the well-worn account of my past",
  "  These conversations with new people are causing me to take a fresh look at my old stories, especially the ones that are largely untold to others, but that have helped form my beliefs about who I am",
  "  I recognize now that the most difficult and challenging times can be framed through the lens of the pain I felt at the time, or reframed through a lens of gratitude for the lessons that came as a result",
  " Living through painful experiences offers us the possibility of welcoming a new beginning, the next phase of our life in which we are wiser, stronger and even more resilient",
  "  When we look back on some of our most challenging times, we can acknowledge the pain they brought while also recognizing some of the positive changes they sparked",
